# An alternate chronology of the crucifixion

> On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.  
-- Julius Africanus (quoted by Syncellus)

> In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars in the heavens were seen. And there was an earthquake in Bithynia which overthrew many houses in the city of Nicaea.  
-- Phlegon of Tralles (quoted by Eusebius)

> And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.  
-- Mark 15:33

> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!  
-- Galatians 3:1

> And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.”  
But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly.  
For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.  
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” 
-- Acts 26:24-27

> But Peter ... raised his voice and addressed them: ‘Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem ... this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:  
“In the last days it will be, God declares,  
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,  
    and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy...  
And I will show portents in the heaven above.  
    and signs on the earth below,  
        blood, and fire, and smoky mist.  
The sun shall be turned to darkness  
    and the moon to blood,  
        before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.  
-- Acts 2:14-20

## Pax Deorum 

> For when the earth, which is the nourisher and the mother, as it were, of all things, is struck with the fires of heaven, and gives forth a groan, and trembles and opens in chasms, it seems to give a warning of divine wrath, and to command us to guard against the impious wickedness of men.
-- Cicero
-- [De Natura Deorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum)

> For what is more pitiable than ignorance of causes, what more shameful? What more shameful than to believe that the heavens are disturbed only when some deity is angry?
-- Seneca the Elder, Naturales Quaestiones, Book 6, Chapter 3, Section 1

> And indeed near Casilinum, some who Caesar had settled as colonists, and near Volaterrae, greatly shaken by a severe earthquake, many buildings were overturned in their cities, many lost in the fields, which was believed to have happened not without the wrath of the gods.
-- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Julius Caesar, Chapter 81

> There had also been portents from heaven and earth, by which not only the common people but also leading men were disturbed. Lightning struck frequently, by which both the Capitol and the Temple of Vesta and the emperor's house were damaged. And frequent earthquakes occurred, by which many cities throughout Campania were overthrown, and more were damaged. All these things were believed to be of divine wrath rather than of chance."
- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Nero, Chapter 32

> That same year [AD 62] an earthquake overthrew a large part of Pompeii, a populous town in Campania, which was followed by a destructive storm and a widespread pestilence in the neighbourhood of the capital. These were interpreted by the superstitious as signs of divine displeasure, and indeed many omens had preceded them.
-- Tacitus, Annals, Book 15, Chapter 22 

> But at Rome all things simultaneously unspeakable, detestable, atrocious: luxury, fires, murders; which, though done by the populace, yet were almost permitted by the imperial power itself. Neither shame nor fear restrained them; all things were lawful, all things unlawful: some called virtue whatever they believed benefited themselves.
-- Tacitus, Histories, Book 1, Chapter 2

> We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.  
-- Romans 8:22-23


> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  
...  
Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  
...  
And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
-- Romans 1:18-32


> Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned ... in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.  
Some ... said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities” — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection...  
So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: ‘To the unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you...  
Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.  
The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,  
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”  
-- Acts 17:16-31

Did Paul attribute his survival of shipwreck and imprisonment (e.g. the earthquake at Philippi) as signs and wonders? 

> For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience — by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God — so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;
-- Romans 15:18-19

>  Now the Jewish festival of Booths was near. So his brothers said to him, ‘Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing... Jesus said to them, ‘My time has not yet come... Go to the festival yourselves...  
But after his brothers had gone to the festival, then he also went, not publicly but as it were in secret... 
About the middle of the festival Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.  
-- John 7:2-14

Jesus is in Jerusalem and the Jews want to kill hime
> At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”  
...  
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?” The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.”
-- John 10:22-33

Jesus goes to a festival in Jerusalem and heals a man on the Sabbath 
> After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  
...  
This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
-- John 5:1-18


> For many days previous there had been slight shocks of earthquake, which were not particularly alarming, because they are common enough in Campania.  
-- [Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus describing the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE](https://cmuntz.hosted.uark.edu/texts/pliny-the-younger/the-eruption-of-vesuvius.html)
