# An alternate chronology of the crucifixion

What if Jesus was crucified around the time of the solar eclipse on 24th November 29AD?

This is what Julius Africanus claims that the historian Thallus proposed. 

> On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.  
-- Julius Africanus (quoted by Syncellus)

I'm going to steel-man the position that in fact Thallus was correct. 

Aside: we don't have Thallus writings so we don't know he actually mentioned the crucifixion. We don't even know when he wrote but there is some conjecture that Josephus referred to him, placing him at around 50AD.

Certainly the chronicler Phlegon of Tralles must be speaking of the same event as that in the synoptic gospels. 

> In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars in the heavens were seen. And there was an earthquake in Bithynia which overthrew many houses in the city of Nicaea.  
-- Phlegon of Tralles (quoted by Eusebius)

> And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.  
-- Mark 15:33


Phlegon may have read the gospels, or is simply aware of some tradition (or neither). Origen indicates Phlegon knew of Jesus and / or Peter. Perhaps Phlegon saw the Christian tradition as a confirmation of an independent non-Christian record (maybe even Thallus).

> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!  
-- Galatians 3:1

> And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.”  
But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly.  
For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.  
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” 
-- Acts 26:24-27

> But Peter ... raised his voice and addressed them: ‘Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem ... this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:  
“In the last days it will be, God declares,  
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,  
    and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy...  
And I will show portents in the heaven above.  
    and signs on the earth below,  
        blood, and fire, and smoky mist.  
The sun shall be turned to darkness  
    and the moon to blood,  
        before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.  
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.        
-- Acts 2:14-21


> Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.  
-- Acts 11:19-21

> Portentous and protracted eclipses of the sun also occur, such as the one after the murder of Caesar, when the sun remained pale for almost a whole year, during which time the produce of the earth was deficient and of poor quality.  
...  
> The only place in the whole world where a comet is worshipped is a temple at Rome. His late Majesty Augustus had deemed this comet very propitious to himself; as it had appeared at the beginning of his rule, at some games which, not long after the decease of his father Caesar, as a member of the college founded by him he was celebrating in honour of Mother Venus. In fact he made public the joy that it gave him in these words: 'On the very days of my Games a comet was visible for seven days in the northern part of the sky. It was rising about an hour before sunset, and was a bright star, visible from all lands. The common people believed that this star signified the soul of Caesar received among the spirits of the immortal gods, and on this account the emblem of a star was added to the bust of Caesar that we shortly afterwards dedicated in the forum.'  
-- Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, Book II, Chapter 25 & 30

All very convenient for Augustus who is seeking to establish the new age of the Roman Empire. 

> In my sixth and seventh consulships, after I had extinguished the flames of civil war, having obtained by universal consent the absolute control of affairs, I transferred the republic from my own control to the will of the Senate and the Roman people. For this service of mine I was named Augustus by decree of the senate, and the door-posts of my house were publicly wreathed with bay leaves and a civic crown was fixed over my door and a golden shield was set in the Curia Julia, which, as attested by the inscription thereon, was given me by the senate and people of Rome on account of my courage, clemency, justice, and piety.

## Pax Deorum 

> For when the earth, which is the nourisher and the mother, as it were, of all things, is struck with the fires of heaven, and gives forth a groan, and trembles and opens in chasms, it seems to give a warning of divine wrath, and to command us to guard against the impious wickedness of men.
-- Cicero
-- [De Natura Deorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum)

> For what is more pitiable than ignorance of causes, what more shameful? What more shameful than to believe that the heavens are disturbed only when some deity is angry?
-- Seneca the Elder, Naturales Quaestiones, Book 6, Chapter 3, Section 1

> And indeed near Casilinum, some who Caesar had settled as colonists, and near Volaterrae, greatly shaken by a severe earthquake, many buildings were overturned in their cities, many lost in the fields, which was believed to have happened not without the wrath of the gods.
-- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Julius Caesar, Chapter 81

> There had also been portents from heaven and earth, by which not only the common people but also leading men were disturbed. Lightning struck frequently, by which both the Capitol and the Temple of Vesta and the emperor's house were damaged. And frequent earthquakes occurred, by which many cities throughout Campania were overthrown, and more were damaged. All these things were believed to be of divine wrath rather than of chance."
- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Nero, Chapter 32

> That same year [AD 62] an earthquake overthrew a large part of Pompeii, a populous town in Campania, which was followed by a destructive storm and a widespread pestilence in the neighbourhood of the capital. These were interpreted by the superstitious as signs of divine displeasure, and indeed many omens had preceded them.
-- Tacitus, Annals, Book 15, Chapter 22 

> But at Rome all things simultaneously unspeakable, detestable, atrocious: luxury, fires, murders; which, though done by the populace, yet were almost permitted by the imperial power itself. Neither shame nor fear restrained them; all things were lawful, all things unlawful: some called virtue whatever they believed benefited themselves.
-- Tacitus, Histories, Book 1, Chapter 2

> We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.  
-- Romans 8:22-23


> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  
...  
Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  
...  
And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
-- Romans 1:18-32


> Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned ... in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.  
Some ... said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities” — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection...  
So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: ‘To the unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you...  
Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.  
The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,  
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”  
-- Acts 17:16-31

Did Paul attribute his survival of shipwreck and imprisonment (e.g. the earthquake at Philippi) as signs and wonders? 

> For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience — by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God — so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;
-- Romans 15:18-19

>  Now the Jewish festival of Booths was near. So his brothers said to him, ‘Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing... Jesus said to them, ‘My time has not yet come... Go to the festival yourselves...  
But after his brothers had gone to the festival, then he also went, not publicly but as it were in secret... 
About the middle of the festival Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.  
-- John 7:2-14

Jesus is in Jerusalem and the Jews want to kill hime
> At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”  
...  
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?” The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.”
-- John 10:22-33

Jesus goes to a festival in Jerusalem and heals a man on the Sabbath 
> After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  
...  
This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
-- John 5:1-18


> For many days previous there had been slight shocks of earthquake, which were not particularly alarming, because they are common enough in Campania.

> The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer. 7 After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.  
-- Numbers 19:6-7

> The Lord said to Moses, “These are the regulations for any diseased person at the time of their ceremonial cleansing, when they are brought to the priest: The priest is to go outside the camp and examine them. If they have been healed of their defiling skin disease,the priest shall order that two live clean birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop be brought for the person to be cleansed. Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot. He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water. Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the defiling disease, and then pronounce them clean. After that, he is to release the live bird in the open fields.  
-- Leviticus 14:1-7
