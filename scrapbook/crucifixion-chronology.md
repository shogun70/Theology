# An alternate chronology of the crucifixion

What if Jesus was crucified around the time of the solar eclipse on 24th November 29AD?

This is what Julius Africanus claims that the historian Thallus proposed. 

> On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.  
-- Julius Africanus (quoted by Syncellus)

I'm going to steel-man the position that in fact Thallus was correct.  

This will involve assuming it is historical, interpreting Paul's letters (and Acts) in that light, and seeing if it seems to corroborate the thesis. 

I will be ignoring unknowable factors such as cloud-cover. 

I'll also have to explain seemingly contradictory evidence, of which the most obvious is that the gospels universally place the crucifixion at Passover.  
But I will look at that **last**.

Aside: we don't have Thallus writings so we don't know he actually mentioned the crucifixion. We don't even know when he wrote but there is some conjecture that Josephus referred to him, placing him at around 50AD.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallus_(historian)

Julian Africanus also claimed that the chronicler Phlegon of Tralles confirmed the same event:

> Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Cæsar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth — manifestly that one of which we speak.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegon_of_Tralles

But this seems like a misrepresentation of Phlegon, given this quote from Eusebius: 

> In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars in the heavens were seen. And there was an earthquake in Bithynia which overthrew many houses in the city of Nicaea.  
-- Phlegon of Tralles (quoted by Eusebius)

Phlegon is certainly referring to the eclipse in November 29AD. 
The noteworthiness of the earthquake is not that several houses fell down. It must be that it coincided with the eclipse. And a total eclipse in Bythnia at around midday is certainly the one in 29AD. 


The synoptic gospel authors claim that this - presumably well attested solar eclipse - corroborated the crucifixion darkness. 

While Mark and Luke only mention the darkness (beginning at the sixth hour), Matthew is all in on highlighting the cosmic significance of the moment. 

> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.  
...  
And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.  
-- Matthew 27:45,51


Phlegon is presumed to have written in the mid-second century, so it is possible he knew of the Christian tradition and viewed it as a confirmation of an independent non-Christian record (maybe even Thallus). 

Plausibly he had even read the gospels, although Origen indicates that while he knew of Jesus and Peter he was uninformed.

> Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events (although falling into confusion about some things which refer to Peter, as if they referred to Jesus), but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.

Since I'm steelmanning, let's presume that Thallus did actually record that Christians were claiming a darkness at Jesus death. This would make him the earliest source for this (if we accept that Thallus wrote mid-first century). 

Is there any potentially corroborating data? 

What about that Antioch was an early stronghold of Chrisitanity? It also would have been right on the path of the total solar eclipse. 

> Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.  
...  
Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch... And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.  
-- Acts 11:19-26

Tarsus would also have been on the path. 
Traditionally, Saint Paul was born in Tarsus but living in or near Jerusalem the church began. 
If his extended family was based in Tarsus it could contribute to explaining why some of his relatives were early converts.

> Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.  
-- Romans 16:7

Saint Paul confirms that he and Peter were both in Antioch and that there were Jewish and Gentile christians.

> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
-- Galatians 2:11-12

More directly, Saint Paul potentially says that the Galatians were in some way eyewitnesses to Jesus crucifixion. 

> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!  
-- Galatians 3:1

Maybe this is even the sense of what is captured in his interaction with King Herod Agrippa: 

> And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.”  
But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly.  
For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.  
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” 
-- Acts 26:24-27


If this is a clue that early Christians were claiming the solar eclipse demonstrated the significance of Jesus death, then it has a strong resonance with the folklore surrounding the assassination of Julius Caesar. 

> Portentous and protracted eclipses of the sun also occur, such as the one after the murder of Caesar, when the sun remained pale for almost a whole year, during which time the produce of the earth was deficient and of poor quality.  
-- Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, Book II, Chapter 30  
(Presumed to be due to Mount Okmuk erupting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Okmok#43_BCE:_Okmok_II_eruption)
  
> The only place in the whole world where a comet is worshipped is a temple at Rome. His late Majesty Augustus had deemed this comet very propitious to himself; as it had appeared at the beginning of his rule, at some games which, not long after the decease of his father Caesar, as a member of the college founded by him he was celebrating in honour of Mother Venus. In fact he made public the joy that it gave him in these words: 'On the very days of my Games a comet was visible for seven days in the northern part of the sky. It was rising about an hour before sunset, and was a bright star, visible from all lands. The common people believed that this star signified the soul of Caesar received among the spirits of the immortal gods, and on this account the emblem of a star was added to the bust of Caesar that we shortly afterwards dedicated in the forum.'  
-- Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, Book II, Chapter 25  
[Caesar's comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Comet)


These celestial events were all very convenient for Augustus who was seeking to establish the new age of the Roman Empire.  

It seems that Saint Peter was also propagandizing a turning point in history.  

> But Peter ... raised his voice and addressed them: ‘Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem ... this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:  
“In the last days it will be, God declares,  
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,  
    and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy...  
And I will show portents in the heaven above.  
    and signs on the earth below,  
        blood, and fire, and smoky mist.  
The sun shall be turned to darkness  
    and the moon to blood,  
        before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.  
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.        
-- Acts 2:14-21

A blood moon can be caused by dust or smoke, but the most common association is with a lunar eclipse. Intriguingly, just two weeks after the solar eclipse there was a lunar eclipse.  
https://eclipsewise.com/lunar/LEprime/0001-0100/LE0029Dec09Pprime.html

Being a partial lunar eclipse it would not be a classic blood moon unless it was accompanied by dust or smoke. But a knowledgeable person could have been able to point it out, especially to people who had seen the total lunar eclipse which occurred six months earlier.

Some christian atheists argue that these Old Testament images of cosmic upheaval would have been understood as metaphor for dramatic socio-political change. 

But any reading of ancient historians demonstrates that even if they themselves were not superstitious, the mass of humanity still was. 

> There had also been portents from heaven and earth, by which not only the common people but also leading men were disturbed. Lightning struck frequently, by which both the Capitol and the Temple of Vesta and the emperor's house were damaged. And frequent earthquakes occurred, by which many cities throughout Campania were overthrown, and more were damaged. All these things were believed to be of divine wrath rather than of chance."  
-- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Nero, Chapter 32

There are hints that Saint Paul - if he didn't exactly think the same - at least tapped into this kind of thinking. 

> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  
...  
Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  
...  
And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
-- Romans 1:18-32

He even seems to allude to seismic activity, like a first century Tim LaHaye.

> We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.  
-- Romans 8:22-23

> The Bible tells us in Matthew 24 that one of the signs of the last days - one of the birth pangs to occur - is an increase in earthquake activity and intensity. We're seeing that happen here. It's not just earthquakes, but hurricanes and all kinds of natural disasters.

Substitute Roman gods for Yahweh, and sometimes Paul doesn't seem so different to prevailing Roman moralizing. 

> For when the earth, which is the nourisher and the mother, as it were, of all things, is struck with the fires of heaven, and gives forth a groan, and trembles and opens in chasms, it seems to give a warning of divine wrath, and to command us to guard against the impious wickedness of men.  
-- [Cicero, De Natura Deorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum)


See also our only hint of Paul preaching to Athenians:

> Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned ... in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.  
Some ... said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities” — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection...  
So Paul ... said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious...  
Being God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.    
The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,  
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”  
-- Acts 17:16-31




## Pax Deorum 

> In my sixth and seventh consulships, after I had extinguished the flames of civil war, having obtained by universal consent the absolute control of affairs, I transferred the republic from my own control to the will of the Senate and the Roman people. For this service of mine I was named Augustus by decree of the senate, and the door-posts of my house were publicly wreathed with bay leaves and a civic crown was fixed over my door and a golden shield was set in the Curia Julia, which, as attested by the inscription thereon, was given me by the senate and people of Rome on account of my courage, clemency, justice, and piety.
-- [Augustus, Res Gestae Divi Augusti](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/augustus-res-gestae/)




> Among events of divine ordering, there was the great comet, which showed itself in great splendour for seven nights after Caesar's murder, and then disappeared; also, the obscuration of the sun's rays. For during all that year its orb rose pale and without radiance, while the heat that came down from it was slight and ineffectual, so that the air in its circulation was dark and heavy owing to the feebleness of the warmth that penetrated it, and the fruits, imperfect and half ripe, withered away and shrivelled up on account of the coldness of the atmosphere.  
-- [Plutarch, The life of Julius Caeser](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html)



> For when the earth, which is the nourisher and the mother, as it were, of all things, is struck with the fires of heaven, and gives forth a groan, and trembles and opens in chasms, it seems to give a warning of divine wrath, and to command us to guard against the impious wickedness of men.

> For what is more pitiable than ignorance of causes, what more shameful? What more shameful than to believe that the heavens are disturbed only when some deity is angry?
-- Seneca the Elder, Naturales Quaestiones, Book 6, Chapter 3, Section 1

> And indeed near Casilinum, some who Caesar had settled as colonists, and near Volaterrae, greatly shaken by a severe earthquake, many buildings were overturned in their cities, many lost in the fields, which was believed to have happened not without the wrath of the gods.
-- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Julius Caesar, Chapter 81

> There had also been portents from heaven and earth, by which not only the common people but also leading men were disturbed. Lightning struck frequently, by which both the Capitol and the Temple of Vesta and the emperor's house were damaged. And frequent earthquakes occurred, by which many cities throughout Campania were overthrown, and more were damaged. All these things were believed to be of divine wrath rather than of chance."
- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Nero, Chapter 32

> That same year [AD 62] an earthquake overthrew a large part of Pompeii, a populous town in Campania, which was followed by a destructive storm and a widespread pestilence in the neighbourhood of the capital. These were interpreted by the superstitious as signs of divine displeasure, and indeed many omens had preceded them.
-- Tacitus, Annals, Book 15, Chapter 22 

> But at Rome all things simultaneously unspeakable, detestable, atrocious: luxury, fires, murders; which, though done by the populace, yet were almost permitted by the imperial power itself. Neither shame nor fear restrained them; all things were lawful, all things unlawful: some called virtue whatever they believed benefited themselves.
-- Tacitus, Histories, Book 1, Chapter 2

Did Paul attribute his survival of shipwreck and imprisonment (e.g. the earthquake at Philippi) as signs and wonders? 

> For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience — by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God — so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;
-- Romans 15:18-19

>  Now the Jewish festival of Booths was near. So his brothers said to him, ‘Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing... Jesus said to them, ‘My time has not yet come... Go to the festival yourselves...  
But after his brothers had gone to the festival, then he also went, not publicly but as it were in secret... 
About the middle of the festival Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.  
-- John 7:2-14

Jesus is in Jerusalem and the Jews want to kill hime
> At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”  
...  
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?” The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.”
-- John 10:22-33

Jesus goes to a festival in Jerusalem and heals a man on the Sabbath 
> After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  
...  
This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
-- John 5:1-18


> For many days previous there had been slight shocks of earthquake, which were not particularly alarming, because they are common enough in Campania.  
-- [Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus describing the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE](https://cmuntz.hosted.uark.edu/texts/pliny-the-younger/the-eruption-of-vesuvius.html)


> The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer. 7 After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.  
-- Numbers 19:6-7

> The Lord said to Moses, “These are the regulations for any diseased person at the time of their ceremonial cleansing, when they are brought to the priest: The priest is to go outside the camp and examine them. If they have been healed of their defiling skin disease,the priest shall order that two live clean birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop be brought for the person to be cleansed. Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot. He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water. Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the defiling disease, and then pronounce them clean. After that, he is to release the live bird in the open fields.  
-- Leviticus 14:1-7


> It is also well to convince ourselves that the gods do none of this; that it is not their anger that shakes heaven and earth. These phenomena have their own causes, and their ravages do not depend on any command, but, as in the human body, are the effect of some disorganizing vices, and when it seems to cause suffering, it is matter that suffers. But everything is terrible for us who are ignorant of the truth, and the rarity of the event increases our terror. Ordinary accidents frighten less; it is the extraordinary that terrifies. And why are some phenomena extraordinary for us? Because we contemplate nature with our eyes and not with our reason; because we think, not about what this nature can do, but about what it has done. The fear we feel about something extraordinary, when it is not extraordinary but unusual, serves as a punishment for our lack of reflection. How so? Is it not true that religious fear takes hold of the mind, and especially of the multitude, when the sun and even the moon, whose eclipses are more frequent, are hidden from us in whole or in part? 
-- Seneca, Natural Questions, Book 6, Chapter 3
