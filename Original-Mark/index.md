# An earlier form of the Gospel according to Mark?

The gospel according to Mark is titled "The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God" (Mark 1:1).
Whether this title was written first or added last, it is clear from the gospel's content 
and the several matching pronouncements that the author knew what the title would be. 
The climax of the gospel is in Mark 15:33-39 where darkness covers the land, Jesus cries out and dies, 
the temple curtain is torn in two, and a Roman centurion proclaims "Surely this man was the Son of God". 
Perhaps surprisingly, this is also the last explicit pronouncement that Jesus is either the Christ or the Son of God. 
This essay will investigate the proposition that this was in fact the original ending of Mark. 

The approach for this investigation will be to look at various pericopes while asking the question:
"did the author know about the tomb when composing this part of the account?"

This exploration must remain inconclusive since there is no definitive gospel narrative material preceding Mark,
but we can compare and contrast these final scenes with the presumed church liturgy in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5.

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received:  
that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  
that he was buried,  
that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  
and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.  


## Aside: Why did Mark go viral?

Matthew doesn't so much use Mark as a source as basically rewriting it, along with the addition of sayings and birth accounts.
Luke says in his foreword that he knows of potentially several written sources but again he starts with Mark and splices alternative material in. 
By the time John is written there is an assumption that the audience is familiar with the synoptic gospels. 
Thus, it seems that shortly after Mark was available it became so popular (even canonical) 
that the authors of Matthew and Luke cannot envisage following a different template, even while seeking to correct and improve it. 
And the author of John, while knowing some other stories - perhaps even another template (the speculated Signs gospel) -
must have had Mark's general narrative committed to memory.

What was it about Mark that led to its dominance of the gospel narrative such that other stories were sidelined or even lost? 
Was it that it addressed a crisis of faith in late first century christianity? 
Two suggestions are offered: 
1. With the first generation of christians dead, there was no-one around to claim "I saw the risen Jesus"
    or even "I knew one of the disciples - you could tell he was sincere about the resurrection."
    Fpr sure there would have been stories about resurrection encounters - perhaps like the disciples on the road to Emmaus. 
    But perhaps these stories were beginning to sound like hallucinations or even cleverly invented tales (c.f. 2 Peter 1:16).
    Seeing how essential the empty tomb is to later gospels and apologetics, it seems reasonable that this account 
    gave christian communities a defense against fears and critiques that their belief was based more-or-less on ghost stories.
2. In the year 64, when Nero was blaming christians for the fire in Rome, and then persecuting them (perhaps even executing Peter and Paul), 
    the community must have been thinking that surely God's judgement of Rome and Jesus's return as ruler must be imminent. 
    When instead - by the year 70 - Rome had crushed the Judean revolt, overrun Jerusalem and destroyed the temple 
    some christians must have felt as though their script had been torn up.
    With Mark able to present the Passion week as largely a story of the temple against Jesus (and against God)
    this could have assured the community that actually things were on track - one opponent defeated, 
    the other will surely either confess Jesus is God's true son or be swept aside in due course.
    (Maybe there was also hope that Jews would join christianity as they were told that God had clearly condemned the alternative.) 


## Mark 15:40 - 16:8: An epilogue?
> There were also women looking on from a distance, 
among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. 
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, 
and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.  
And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, 
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. 
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. 
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph.  
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, 
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. 
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.  
When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.  
And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.  
And they were saying to one another,  
“Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”  
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — it was very large.  
And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. 
And he said to them,  
“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. 
But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”  
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, 
and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

### A (nearly) complete change of cast.

Mark 15:40-43 introduces several new characters who are critical to the rest of the gospel:
- many female disciples from Galilee, and 
- Joseph of Arimathea.

If we read the New Testament chronologically according to when it was written, 
this is the first occasion where it was recorded that the earthly Jesus even had female followers.
At a minimum this is consistent with what we would expect if this scene was appended later.
Even if this story predated the composition of Mark 
one would strongly expect that there would be some detail regarding these female disciples from Galilee when Jesus was in Galilee 
(an omission finally addressed by Luke 8:1-3)
and that these women might be mentioned during the crucifixion procession (somewhat addressed in Luke 23:27)
or at least while Jesus is dying (fixed in John 19:25).
Thus, it seems clear that in Mark these women are introduced, not because they are followers 
but precisely so some minor (or even hitherto unknown) characters can find the empty tomb.
(ASIDE: Strangely it seems clear that one of these women is Mary, the mother of Jesus, 
but here only identified as the mother of James and Joses.
John seems to be aware of this mistake and explicitly places Jesus's mother at the cross.
This vagueness about one of the women could be a hint that the story evolved separately to the rest of Mark. )

Similarly, Joseph of Arimathea's role is solely to get Jesus taken down from the cross and placed in a tomb. 
Being supposedly a prominent member of the Council (the same council which condemned Jesus) 
and according to later gospels someone who at minimum respected Jesus,
he would have been ideally placed to confirm that the tomb in which he placed Jesus was indeed empty. 
It seems that when this ending to Mark was written it was convenient that the empty tomb was a women's secret.  
TODO: Explore the implications of Joseph of Arimathea's role being so stable in the canonical gospels. 
Also Acts 13:29:
>  And when **they** had carried out all that was written of him, **they** took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.

It isn't a complete change of cast - Pilate and the centurion are prominent in the preceding scene and also have parts in this epilogue.
This might suggest original continuity in Mark 15 but it could just as easily be explained by an intelligent playwright 
seeking to make the scenes flow. 

There is however, one essential character who may have already been introduced - the young man at the tomb in Mark 16:5. 
If this is meant to be the same young man who fled naked in Gethsemane (Mark 14:51) then he could have been introduced earlier in preparation for his role at the empty tomb. 
Four explanations are proposed:
1. The two young men are the same person and Mark 14 is intentionally introducing him into the story before his main role in Mark 16. 
2. The two young men are the same person but he is only added to Mark 16 for the sake of continuity - 
    perhaps the audience were meant to presume it was he who had rolled away the stone.
3. The young man in Mark 14 is not the same as the one in Mark 16. 
    This might be reasonable as clearly later gospels interpret the latter "young man" as an angel.
4. The aside in Mark 14 was inserted after the empty tomb story was, perhaps as a border annotation. 
    This might be reasonable as the account of Jesus's arrest flows better without it, 
    not to mention that all the later gospels exclude it.


### Timeline considerations.

Jesus is crucified on the Day of Preparation before the Sabbath, however this information is not disclosed until after his death and the story needs to justify a quick burial. 
On the other hand, Jesus dies at around 3PM which possibly allows time for the burial arrangements and this information does precede the proposed original ending. 

Jesus is buried on the day before the Sabbath, but the women visit the tomb on the day after, meaning the second day. 
Yet the liturgy from 1 Corinthians 15 and several predictions in Mark say the resurrection is on (or after) the third day.
(This contradiction isn't fixed until John.)

The women's reason to visit the tomb is to anoint the body but that seems implausible - you anoint the body before burial -
an issue not resolved until John. 
However, this might actually be an indicator of continuity with the rest of Mark 
as it might be foreshadowed in Jesus's anointing in Bethany:

> And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, 
a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. 
There were some who said to themselves indignantly, 
“Why was the ointment wasted like that? For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” 
And they scolded her. 
But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 
For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me. 
She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. 
And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”
>
> -- <cite>Mark 14:3-9</cite>

Alternatively it could be argued that since the anointing at Bethany undermines the explanation 
for why the women went to the tomb it wouldn't have been included if the author was thinking about the empty tomb scene.
It also seems strange that when Mark was written this anonymous woman was remembered - 
is that likely if in fact the named women who buy spices and find the empty tomb was a well known story?


## Predictions of death and resurrection.

Jesus predicts his death and / or resurrection several times.
(Perhaps surprisingly the only time his burial is predicted is in the aforementioned "Anointing at Bethany")
While the audience doubtless was familiar with Jesus being crucified and appearing afterward,
does it make sense for Mark to include the predictions and then only retell the crucifixion?
On the other hand, would an audience accept an empty tomb but no resurrection appearances 
as a satisfactory fulfillment to the very same play?

Let's look closer at these predictions while considering a few questions:
1. Is the prediction of resurrection consistent with Mark 15-16?
2. Could the prediction of the resurrection have been added later, perhaps initially from a border annotation? Does the text flow just as well without it?
3. Could the prediction of resurrection simply be liturgical, always accompanying the crucifixion, 
    perhaps following the precedent of 1 Corinthians 15:3-5?


### Mark 8:27-33
> And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi.  
And on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”  
And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”  
And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?”  
Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.”  
And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.  
And he began to teach them that  
> 
> **the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed,  
> and after three days rise again.**  
>
> And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 
But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said,  
“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”

Notwithstanding the second day resurrection, this prediction is not inconsistent with the canonical ending of Mark.
Certainly the proportions in detail of the suffering and condemnation versus the resurrection 
is a decent match for that presented in the final chapters of Mark. 

From our perspective it seems odd that Peter would rebuke Jesus for speaking about resurrection,
but naturally at this point in the story the disciples are dreaming of an earthly kingdom.

Unlike the 1 Corinthians 15 liturgy, the prediction does not include burial, 
nor does it explicitly include Jesus being seen by disciples.
(This sets a precedent for most of the rest of Mark and indeed all the gospels.)

This omission of burial feels a little surprising if the burial was an important part of the narrative before Mark was compiled. 
One might speculate that since the prediction of resurrection is so short it could be added after the proposed epilogue became established. 
However, if it was added later, mightn't we also expect it to include a short "and buried"? 
Moreover, by the time Matthew is written there has been no urge to revise the prediction. 

Overall it feels like it is probably based on contemporary liturgy - 
especially as it is repeated - with adjustment - two more times in Mark.
The only earlier liturgy we know is that in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received:  
_(1a)_    that Christ died for our sins  
_(1b)_        in accordance with the Scriptures,  
_(1c)_           that he was buried,  
_(2a)_    that he was raised on the third day  
_(2b)_        in accordance with the Scriptures,  
_(2c)_             and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.

While this prediction in Mark varies considerably, 
it could be argued that it is a decent match for the lines (1a and 2a) claimed to be in accordance with scripture. 

### Mark 9:30-35
> They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, because he was teaching his disciples.  
He said to them, 
> 
> **"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, 
> and after three days he will rise."**  
>
> But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.  
> And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”  
> But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.  
> And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, 
> “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.”

This feels much the same as the preceding prediction, 
but significantly it is immediately followed by a contrasting episode of 
the disciples arguing about relative importance. 

### Mark 10:32-45
> And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. 
And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. 
And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, saying,  
> 
> **“See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. 
> And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.”**  
>
> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” 
And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” 
Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” 
And they said to him, “We are able.” 
And Jesus said to them, 
“The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, 
but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 
And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. 
And Jesus called them to him and said to them, 
“You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 
But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 
and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. 
>
> **For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”**


This feels much the same as the earlier predictions,
and once again is followed by disciples - this time explicitly James and John - petitioning for importance 
revealing that they must presume Jesus's prediction is symbolic. 
This is of course consistent with their abandonment of Jesus when he is meekly arrested. 

These repeated examples of the disciples jockeying for position are highly suggestive 
that this was Peter's motivation when he initially rebuked Jesus. 


### Mark 14:17-31
> And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. 
And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.” 
They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?” 
He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. 
For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! 
It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”
And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.” 
And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. 
And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. 
Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
And Jesus said to them,  
>
> **“You will all fall away, for it is written,  
> ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’  
> But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”**  
> 
> Peter said to him, “Even though they all fall away, I will not.” 
And Jesus said to him, “Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” 
But he said emphatically, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.


The prediction after the Last Supper adds the information that the disciples will desert Jesus but also encounter the resurrected Jesus in Galilee. 
This is echoed in the words of the young man at the empty tomb. 
Some might say this demonstrates a tell towards the empty tomb scene. 
Others might assert that it suggests there was going to be an ending in Galilee, much like Matthew 28. 
Alternatively, the sentence "But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee" 
doesn't break the flow of the text whether it is included or left out - it isn't impossible that it was a later addition.

There is also the inference in Jesus's words in the last Supper that Jesus will drink wine in the kingdom of God, 
although arguably this is just creative rewriting of 1 Corinthians 10:23-26. 


### Mark 9:1-13
> And he said to them,
“Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power.”
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And he was transfigured before them, and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them.
And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
And Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified.
And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son; listen to him.”
And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.
And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean.
And they asked him, “Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?”
And he said to them, “Elijah does come first to restore all things.
And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.”

If any of canonical Mark is reminiscent of Papias's "unordered" Mark it is this passage.
Is the prediction of some standing there seeing the kingdom of God coming in power immediately fulfilled in the transfiguration? Surely that doesn't make sense dramatically.
Is the transfiguration meant to be a proof for Peter, James, and John (and the audience) that the future is guaranteed? c.f. 2 Peter 1:17,18
Why are James and John in Mark 10 so forward about wanting status when it seems they have already been given it? 
Or could it be that this story began as a resurrection account as in Matthew 28:16 and was repurposed to be used into the main story?
Certainly Matthew sees fit to have both the transfiguration and the great commissioning which presumably occurred on the same Holy mountain.

Interestingly there is no prediction of the crucifixion here.
The resurrection prediction feels neither liturgical nor like a side note which made its way into the text.
The disciples reaction of "questioning what this rising from the dead might mean" does perhaps feel consistent
with canonical Mark's ambiguous ending.


### Partially fulfilled predictions?  

Let's assume that all the resurrection predictions were in the earliest form of Mark, whether liturgical or more intentional. 
Is the canonical ending consistent, and if not, why not?

The canonical ending of Mark has some consistency with these predictions - it shows Jesus being killed, provides a symbol of resurrection, 
and repeats that the disciples will encounter Jesus in Galilee.  

The predictions never mention that Jesus would be buried which is a little surprising in the light of 1 Corinthians 15. 
Could that be a hint that Mark was initially composed when the burial wasn't an essential part of contemporary retellings?
Parhaps the Passion Week stories were retold before Easter and there were separate resurrection tellings after Easter.

The resurrection does seem to be after two days rather than three (an issue explicitly fixed in John) 
so it might be reasonable to infer that the resurrection predictions are original. 

But do the consistencies indicate that when the author wrote the predictions into the script he also knew he was going to fulfil them without appearances? 
Could he have originally assumed that the predictions themselves were satisfactory to imply the resurrection appearances after the gospel's climax? 
Certainly the original audience would be familiar with some resurrection stories?
Indeed the enhanced endings in the later gospels (and the longer endings of Mark) 
imply that within a few decades audiences weren't satisfied with even the inference supplied by the empty tomb
and were demanding more explicit accounts.
This is still the case in the modern era, with none less than Bruce Megzter opining that surely this wasn't the intended ending of Mark. **citation needed**

Alternatively, could it be that what appears to be vaguely fulfilled predictions 
were actually meant to remind the audience that part of the fulfillment was yet to come,  
perhaps even in the original audiences own timeframe? 
Or lack of resurrection appearances might be giving permission to anyone to have an encounter with the resurrected Jesus. 


## John's death, burial, and resurrection. 

Perhaps surprisingly, Jesus is not the only prophet to be executed, buried in a tomb, and have resurrection appearances. 

### Mark 16:14-29
> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. 
Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
Others said, “He is Elijah.”
And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.”
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and 
...
he sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. 
...
On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.


Considering the potential comparisons between John's and Jesus's resurrections it is perhaps surprising that John's story is almost an afterthought. 
In fact the manifestation of the resurrected John the Baptist - that is Jesus's miracles - are presented before the account of John's death. 
At the very least this pericope demonstrates that stories about resurrection did not need to be accompanied by an empty tomb. 
It is perhaps also indicative that the concept of resurrection was amorphous - maybe even flexible - in first century Judeo-Christian communities.
c.f. Josephus's descriptions of the range of Jewish belief's about the afterlife and the possible hints at transmigration or reincarnation. **citation needed**


## Hopeless disciples

Jesus not only predicts his own death and resurrection, but also the desertion of his disciples. 
But implied in the predictions is that they aren't going to be left in their hopelessness.  
Of course, the audience could be expected to be familiar with the disciples continued role in the spreading of the Good News, 
but did the author know how he was going to confirm those inferences when he included the predictions? 
Perhaps the author was anticipating using a resurrection story which included the disciples -  
for example Jesus walking on the water, or even the transfiguration where Jesus is declared the Son of God.
(As suggested by Dominic Crossan. **citation needed**)

This essayist at least finds it implausible that there wasn't some (perhaps non-authoritative) sequels to Mark 
which contained accounts with restored disciples and perhaps resurrection encounters. 
But if this theory is granted then it raises the question - 
why did Mark go viral / become authoritative without any of the sequels?

## The evolution of Mark

None of the New Testament letters (or even the letters of the early church fathers) mention the tomb, 
yet starting with Mark, all the narrative gospels do. Indeed, the story becomes more embellished, 
presumably as critics or even christians begin to question its trustworthiness.

Assuming, for the sake of argument,that the burial and empty tomb narrative is a late addition, 
let us (wildly) speculate how might Mark have evolved?
We have no texts to work with - just like Q, the presumed proto-Mark is lost, or rather absorbed into the canonical gospels -
but we do have Eusebius's quote of Papias's hearsay that the Presbyter John claimed that Mark wrote an unordered collection of Peter's anecdotes on the life of Jesus. **citation needed**
It seems reasonable that such a text would have some perceived authority, and it begins to be shared amongst a small network of christian communities.

After the fall of Jerusalem - and the temple - there is a faith crisis regarding the apparent invincibility of the Roman empire 
and the ongoing stresses on the christian communities. 
This is handled in various ways (including abandonment of faith) but the dominant apologetic is the Passion Week play, 
which draws on some of the proto-Mark material 
with the addition that it pits Jesus against the temple (which explains the temple's destruction)
and ends with a Roman centurion acknowledging that Jesus is a Son of God (a premonition of what will surely happen in the audience's time).
After a few years the play and some of the other stories from proto-Mark are assembled - perhaps by an acolyte of Mark - 
into a final written form of "the Good News of Jesus Christ the Son of God".

One Passover / Easter there is a novel addition to a performance of the Passion Week plays - 
reminiscent of the Graeco-Roman trope of an empty tomb signifying a person has been taken up to the gods, 
in this scene some anonymous women are going to visit a tomb to mourn and inexplicably find it open. c.f. Robin Faith Walsh **citation needed**
Perhaps the Passion week play had even been performed as a sequence of short plays in the week before Easter 
and then the empty tomb scene is really first performed on the first day of the week. 
The audience, mostly aware of the trope, understands the significance and it feels like a satisfying epilogue.

As this well received epilogue spreads in the small network it gets modified to make the links with the gospel stronger. 
Some new hearers assume it is meant to be true and some apologetic reworking is applied - 
this requires making it flow on from the crucifixion scene (when they are performed together) and also some deanonymizing.  
A less well versed person has asked what is the significance of the empty tomb
so a "young man dressed in white" is introduced to give a more direct explanation (initially this is probably simply the narrator).
Joseph of Arimathea may well have been a Sanhedrin delegate for arranging burials of criminals.
The day of preparation is used as a reason to get Jesus off the cross (although it results in the resurrection being after only two days - an issue not fixed until John).
The female disciples - they have to be female because everyone knows the disciples weren't preaching the empty tomb - 
were possibly known from other stories about Jesus. Or perhaps they were even well known deceased Jewish women from the community.

\[ASIDE: In 1 Corinthians 15 there is a reference to "The Twelve" to whom Jesus appeared but no detail of who is included or even when they became known as such.
The gospels all claim that Jesus chose The Twelve and provide names, although these are not consistent and they even include Judas who obviously isn't in Paul's "The Twelve". 
Amongst bible scholars there is some openness to the suggestion that several of those listed were Jesus's brothers. 
Surprisingly, Papias provides a shorter list of seven - Andrew, Peter, Philip, Thomas, James, John, Matthew. 
The gospels also have inconsistency (and vagueness) amongst the lists of women who went to the tomb. 
They all include Mary Magdalene, and the synoptics all include another Mary. They all have hints at other women.
Now if we look at Luke 23:55 he says it was "the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee" 
and in Luke 24:10 he reports that "it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them". 
If we look back at Luke 8:1-3 he notes that the female followers included Mary Magadelene, Joanna, Susanna, and others. 
We could infer that Luke potentially has four named women at the empty tomb. 
The only other female follower mentioned in the context of Jesus's tomb is Salome in Mark.
In total we seem to have the potential for five named women at the tomb.
Add that to Papias's seven male disciples and we have **twelve**. 
This is probably just coincidence and obviously very tenuous, but it would make sense that 
if Paul's "The Twelve" contained women then some memory of that could leak into the empty tomb narrative
when the story tellers aren't happy with an initial anonymous account. \]

By the time the epilogue arrives back at the community where the gospel had been first finalized 
it is close to fully formed and some people are arguing that it sounds credible and should be added to the gospel. 

This then becomes the final version of Mark which goes viral thus forming the basis for what a gospel must include.
