# An earlier form of the Gospel according to Mark?

> -- <cite>John Dominic Crossan, The Historical Jesus p. 415</cite>

The gospel according to Mark is titled "The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God" (Mark 1:1).
Whether this title was written first or added last, it is clear from the gospel's content 
and the several matching pronouncements that the author knew what the title would be. 
The climax of the gospel is in Mark 15:33-39 where darkness covers the land, Jesus cries out and dies, 
the temple curtain is torn in two, and a Roman centurion proclaims "Surely this man was the Son of God". 
Perhaps surprisingly, this is also the last explicit pronouncement that Jesus is either the Christ or the Son of God. 
This essay will investigate the proposition that this was in fact the original ending of Mark. 

The approach for this investigation will be to look at various pericopaes while asking the question:
"did the author know about the tomb when composing this part of the account?"

This exploration must remain inconclusive since there is no definitive gospel narrative material preceding Mark,
but we can compare and contrast with the presumed church liturgy in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5.

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received:  
that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  
that he was buried,  
that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  
and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.  


## Aside: Why did Mark go viral?

Matthew doesn't so much use Mark as a source as basically rewriting it, along with the addition of sayings and birth accounts.
Luke says in his foreword that he knows of potentially several written sources but again he starts with Mark and splices alternative material in. 
By the time John is written there is an assumption that the audience is familiar with the synoptic gospels. 
Thus, it seems that shortly after Mark was available it became so popular (even canonical) 
that the authors of Matthew and Luke cannot envisage following a different template, even while seeking to correct and improve it. 
And the author of John, while knowing some other stories - perhaps even another template (the speculated Signs gospel) -
must have had Mark's general narrative committed to memory.

What was it about Mark that led to its dominance of the gospel narrative such that other stories were sidelined or even lost? 
Was it that it addressed a crisis of faith in late first century christianity? 
Two suggestions are offered: 
1. With the first generation of christians dead, there was no-one around to claim "I saw the risen Jesus"
    or even "I knew one of the disciples - you could tell he was sincere about the resurrection."
    For sure there were stories about resurrection encounters - perhaps like the disciples on the road to Emmaus. 
    But perhaps these stories were beginning to sound like hallucinations or even cleverly invented tales (c.f. 2 Peter 1:16).
    Knowing how essential the empty tomb is to later gospels and apologetics, it seems reasonable that this account 
    gave christian communities a defense against fears and critiques that their belief was based more-or-less on ghost stories.
2. In the year 64, when Nero was blaming christians for the fire in Rome, and then persecuting them (perhaps even executing Peter and Paul), 
    the community must have been thinking that surely God's judgement of Rome and Jesus's return as ruler must be imminent. 
    When instead - by the year 70 - Rome had crushed the Judean revolt, overrun Jerusalem and destroyed the temple 
    some christians must have felt as though their script had been torn up.  
    Another Caesar, another triumph. Pax Romana. Peace through the sword. The gospel of Caesar is just getting started.  
    With Mark able to present the Passion week as largely a story of the temple against Jesus (and against God) - 
    and with Rome in fact being manipulated by the Jewish leaders -
    this could have assured the community that actually things were on track. 
    With one opponent defeated, the other will surely either confess Jesus is God's true son or be swept aside in due course.
    (Maybe there was also hope that Jews would join christianity as they were told that God had clearly judged the alternative.) 


## Mark 15:40 - 16:8: A postscript?
> There were also women looking on from a distance, 
among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. 
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, 
and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.  
And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, 
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. 
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. 
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph.  
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, 
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. 
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.  
When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.  
And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.  
And they were saying to one another,  
“Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”  
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — it was very large.  
And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. 
And he said to them,  
“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. 
But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”  
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, 
and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

### A (nearly) complete change of cast.

Mark 15:40-43 introduces several new characters who are critical to the rest of the gospel:
- many female disciples from Galilee, and 
- Joseph of Arimathea.

#### Female disciples

If we read the New Testament chronologically according to when it was written, 
this is the first occasion where it was recorded that the earthly Jesus even had female followers.
At a minimum this is consistent with what we would expect if this scene was appended later.
Even if this story predated the composition of Mark 
one would strongly expect that there would be some detail regarding these female disciples from Galilee when Jesus was in Galilee 
(an omission finally addressed by Luke 8:1-3)
and that these women might be mentioned during the crucifixion procession (somewhat addressed in Luke 23:27)
or at least while Jesus is dying (fixed in John 19:25). 

There is an anomaly regarding the frequent and inconsistent repetition of the named women. 

> There were also women looking on from a distance,
among whom were **Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome**.
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him ...

> And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
**Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses** saw where he was laid.  
When the Sabbath was past, **Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome** bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.

If this account is read in one go, this repetition feels clumsy.
There is no comparable instance of excessively redundant (and inconsistent) identification of characters in the rest of Mark.
Matthew and Luke also seem to have felt the clunkiness -
at least Matthew reduces the inconsistency and Luke eliminates redundancy by naming the women only once.
(It is probably oversight that John doesn't include the women witnessing the actual burial in the tomb.)

If the account is treated as a play -
with a distinct scene change between the burial and the discovery of the empty tomb -
then the repetition is less jarring.
However, the inconsistency in identifying **Mary the mother of James and of Joses**
combined with the omission of Salome one time 
might be suggestive of an instance of writer fatigue as the author narrator notices
that he missed out James in the first repetition and so deliberately leaves out Joses on the second.

It is worth considering that the apparent clunkiness disappears if the women are completely removed from the scene on the day of crucifixion.
This might reflect an earlier draft of the postscript, with Jesus being buried on the Day of Preparation,
and the women not being introduced until the first day of the week 
and thus only named once. 

Along the same lines, it is superfluous to have the young men tell the women to "see the place where they laid him"
when in the burial scene just before we are assured that the women "saw where he was laid."
A similar redundancy can be observed in the young man's comment to the women that they
"seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified".
Again, this would not be surprising if an earlier draft did not introduce the women until the empty tomb scene.
On the other hand, these redundancies could be seen as justified for the purpose of dramatization.

<details>
<summary>Mary, the mother of ...</summary>
Strangely it seems clear that one of these women is Mary, the mother of Jesus, 
but here only identified as the mother of James and Joses.
John seems to be aware of this mistake and explicitly places Jesus's mother at the cross. 
This vagueness about one of the women could be a hint that the story evolved separately to the rest of Mark.
</details>


#### Joseph from Arimathea 

Similarly, Joseph of Arimathea's solitary role is to get Jesus taken down from the cross and placed in a tomb. 
Being supposedly a prominent member of the Council (the same council which condemned Jesus) 
he would have been ideally placed to confirm that the tomb in which he placed Jesus was indeed empty. 
It seems that when this ending to Mark was written it was convenient that the empty tomb was a women's secret. 
While it could be argued that this is consistent with the theme of the Messianic Secret, 
it does match what we would expect if the ending was designed not to blatantly contradict 
with the contemporary model of post-crucifixion events. 

Unlike the women, Joseph of Arimathea's role is extraordinarily stable in all the canonical gospels. 
The only significant variation in the synoptics is that he is called a disciple of Jesus in Matthew
compared to "waiting for the Kingdom of God" in Mark and Luke.

In John he is called a secret disciple, and of course he is accompanied by Nicodemus who brings pickles, 
and they wrap the body with strips of linen rather than the implied shroud of the synoptics. 

The less obvious but more significant variation in John is that 
it was "the Jewish leaders \[who\] did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath" - 
this also implies that all the crucified men were buried on the same day. 
This actually aligns with what we would expect (c.f. Josephus **[citation needed]**) 
and it also feels more consistent with Paul's speech in the synagogue at Pisidian Antioch 

> **For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers**,  
> because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, 
> fulfilled them by condemning him.  
> And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.  
> And when they had carried out all that was written of him,  
> **they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb**.
> 
> -- <cite>Acts 13:27-29</cite>

If we order these accounts of Jesus's burial from generic to specific we see:

1. he was buried (1 Corinthians 15)
2. he was buried by the Jewish leaders who had condemned him (Acts 13, hinted at in John 19)
3. he was buried by a Jewish leader - Joseph of Arimathea - who hadn't condemned him (Mark 15 and all the synoptics)
4. he was buried by two Jewish leaders - Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus - who were secret followers (John 19)

This usage is suggestive - to this essayist at least - 
that Joseph of Arimathea is incorporated into the accounts only when he becomes convenient to the story. 

This suggestion is perhaps strengthened by a small mismatch between Mark's burial and empty tomb scenes - 
in the latter the young man urges the women to

> "... see the place where **they** laid him."

This plural "they" contradicts with the presentation of a single person responsible for the burial in Mark 15:

> **Joseph** bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud
and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And **he** rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

This could be a hint that the empty tomb scene predated the burial scene,
or at least a burial scene which relies on Joseph of Arimathea.
(While it is possible that "they laid him" is more-or-less a turn of phrase, 
it should also be noted that Matthew changes this direction to "see the place where he lay!" 
and Luke removes it completely.)

The preceding analysis does not imply that Joseph was not a historical person - quite the opposite: 
the stability of his role surely argues there was no controversy about the claim that he could have buried Jesus. 
John's handling of the burial implies that if there was controversy it was whether:  
- the other crucified men would be left on their crosses while Jesus is taken down, and 
- Matthew's addition that Joseph was a disciple of Jesus. 

If John's additions are in response to controversy 
this actually strengthens the case for Joseph of Arimathea being - like Nicodemus - 
a real member of the Sanhedrin who probably was involved in burying executed people. 


#### Returning characters

It isn't a complete change of cast - Pilate and the centurion are prominent in the preceding scene and also have parts in this epilogue.
This might suggest original continuity in Mark 15, but it could just as easily be explained by an intelligent playwright 
seeking to make the scenes flow. 

There is however, one essential character who may have already been introduced - the young man at the tomb in Mark 16:5. 
If this is meant to be the same young man who fled naked in Gethsemane (Mark 14:51) then he could have been introduced earlier in preparation for his role at the empty tomb. 
Four explanations are proposed:
1. The two young men are the same person and Mark 14 is intentionally introducing him into the story before his main role in Mark 16. 
2. The two young men are the same person but he is only added to Mark 16 for the sake of continuity - 
    perhaps the audience were meant to presume it was he who had rolled away the stone.
3. The young man in Mark 14 is not the same as the one in Mark 16. 
    This might be reasonable as clearly later gospels interpret the latter "young man" as an angel.
4. The aside in Mark 14 was inserted after the empty tomb story was, perhaps as a border annotation. 
    This might be reasonable as the account of Jesus's arrest flows better without it, 
    not to mention that all the later gospels exclude it.  
    It also seems unlikely that the arresting committee don't seek to arrest Jesus's disciples 
    but do chase after this poor juvenile. 


### Timeline considerations.

#### Day of Preparation 

Jesus is crucified on the Day of Preparation before the Sabbath, 
however this information is not disclosed until after his death and the story needs to justify a quick burial. 
On the other hand, Jesus dies at around 3PM (the ninth hour) 
which possibly allows time for the burial arrangements; 
and this information does precede the proposed original ending. 

#### Regular timestamps

It should be noted that there is a strong continuity in the timestamps of the day:
- Jesus is brought to Pilate "as soon as it was morning";  
- he is crucified when "it was the third hour";  
- a darkness covers the land "when the sixth hour had come";  
- he dies "at the ninth hour";  
- he is taken from the cross "when evening had come".  

Once you see the pattern it is hard not to think that the timestamps were deliberately included to mark out a **whole** day. 
This doesn't rule out the speculated postscript, 
but it would probably require also speculating some (minor) reworking of the entire Mark 15.

#### "After three days"

Jesus is buried on the day of preparation for the Sabbath, 
but the women visit the tomb on the first day of the week, that is, the day after the Sabbath. 
Thus, the resurrection is discovered on the second day. 
Yet the liturgy from 1 Corinthians 15 says the resurrection was on the third day, 
and several predictions in Mark say the resurrection is after three days. 
This contradiction in timelines isn't fixed until John.

Intriguingly, both Matthew and Luke change all the "after three days" predictions in Mark to "on the third day". 
Is this done in deference to 1 Corinthians 15, 
or an attempt to argue that - with inclusive counting - the day after tomorrow is consistent with the prophecy? 
No matter; unlike John, they seem to feel locked in to the timeline established by Mark. 

Surprisingly, Matthew has several other instances of "three days" rather than "on the third day", 
and even both together in the account of posting the guard at the tomb:

> “Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 
> ‘After three days I will rise.’ 
> Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, 
> lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 
> ‘He has risen from the dead’
> 
> -- <cite>Matthew 27:63-64</cite>

It seems disingenuous to claim that the burial to empty tomb interval matches the liturgy, at least as expressed in Mark. 

#### Anointing the body for burial

The women's reason to visit the tomb is to anoint the body but that seems implausible - you anoint the body before burial -
a detail resolved in Matthew by not mentioning it, and in John by having Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus perform it. 
It could be argued that in Mark this is actually an indicator of continuity 
as it might be foreshadowed in Jesus's anointing in Bethany:

> And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, 
a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. 
There were some who said to themselves indignantly, 
“Why was the ointment wasted like that? For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” 
And they scolded her. 
But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 
For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me. 
She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. 
And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”
>
> -- <cite>Mark 14:3-9</cite>

Alternatively, since the anointing at Bethany undermines the explanation for why the women went to the tomb,
one might ask why would it be included if the author was thinking about the empty tomb scene? 
It also seems strange that - when Mark was written - it is this **anonymous** woman who was remembered. 
Is that likely if in fact the **named** women who buy spices and find the empty tomb was a well known story?


### Other questions

#### The linen smock

Joseph of Arimathea wraps Jesus in a linen cloth (typically translated shroud). 
The young man fleeing the arrest scene is wearing a linen cloth; and it is taken from him. 
These are the only times linen is mentioned in Mark 
(or any fabric apart from John's camel hair coat and leather belt). 
It is hard not to believe that there is some connection between these two, 
especially if one takes into account that there is also an anonymous young man in the empty tomb scene. 
Moreover, the linen shroud feels like Chekhov's gun - 
surely there is an implicit stage direction that when the young man is telling the women to "see the place where they laid him" 
he is also gesturing towards an empty linen shroud. 
It is easy to imagine that this stage direction was the origin of the explicit finding of the burial cloths 
by Peter (Luke 24:12) and John (John 20:4). 

#### Verification of death

There is one possible (but tiny) mismatch when referring to Jesus's "body":

- In Mark 15:43, Joseph of Arimathea "went to Pilate and asked for the **body** (σῶμα) of Jesus".
- After the toing-and-froing in Mark 15:44-45 where Pilate gets confirmation that Jesus has died,
  he "granted the **corpse** (πτῶμα) to Joseph."

Mark also uses the term "πτῶμα" when referring to John the Baptist's body in Mark 6:29, 
so it would seem reasonable to ignore this mismatch, 
except for the finding that neither Matthew nor Luke even have this verification of Jesus's death 
(although John does have a vaguely similar account with both Pilate and a soldier being involved).

This could be a hint at a more primitive version of the scene where
the death of Jesus on the day of crucifixion wasn't being questioned.  
Intriguingly this would imply that the centurion initially had no role in the post-crucifixion script.

But if we grant this proposition then how do we explain both Matthew and Luke leaving out
what seems like an important detail? 
We could propose that it was added many years later,  
but this raises the question of why it seems to be in all our copies of Mark.

#### The disciples and Peter

Benard Muller has pointed out that the young man's instruction to "go, tell his disciples and Peter"
is not consistent with the rest of Mark,
but is a decent match for the 1 Corinthians 15 liturgy
where Christ "appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve."
Is this a hint that it formed from a different tradition?
The counter to this would be that it could have been intentionally phrased so as
to differentiate Peter as the most faithful - being the last to desert Jesus -
and / or providing a special message of restoration from his shame of denying Jesus at the end.

#### "I will go before you to Galilee"

In Mark 16:7 it is implied that both the women and the young man had heard Jesus say that he would go before them to Galilee.
Yet when Jesus does say this - at the Last Supper or while leaving it - we don't hear about either party.
In fact, neither the women nor the young man have even been introduced.  

Matthew - perhaps seeking to address this potential confusion -
has an angel (instead of the young man) say "There you will see him. **See, I have told you**."

I guess an angel can be presumed to know Jesus's movements without being at the Last Supper. 
And perhaps - as has been suggested **[citation needed]** - 
the young man is meant to be an angel, or at least the omniscient narrator. 

But how can the women be meant to already know? A few suggestions are offered: 

- the women didn't know but the young man is really reminding the audience of Jesus's words. 
- the women didn't know and this was just an oversight by the author. 
- the audience understands that Jesus made this pronouncement at other unmentioned times, or 
- the women were at the Last Supper (and maybe the young man was too).  

Arguably this last option is plausible, see Mark 14:12-20. 

> ... his disciples said to him,  
> “Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”  
> And he sent two of his disciples   
> ...  
> And the disciples set out and went to the city ... and they prepared the Passover.  
> And when it was evening, he came with the twelve.  
> And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said,  
> “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.”   
> ...  
> He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.”

In a dramatization of this scene there will be an implicit stage direction 
that the women (and young man) are present when Jesus makes his pronouncement about going to Galilee. 

Assuming this does raise other questions though, e.g. 
if the women had heard Jesus's prediction in front of the Twelve, and had just heard that it was fulfilled - 
and perhaps knew the young man (if he was at the Last Supper) - 
why do they run away and tell no-one? 

Perhaps the young man's directive to go to Galilee is really just a reminder to the audience 
that the Galilee is the setting for the resurrection encounter re-enactments? 

#### The location of appearances

Is it significant that the prediction that it is in Galilee "you will see him" seems to include the women? 
Could this reflect some memory that the women were amongst the first to experience the risen Jesus in Galilee?

No matter; based on Mark we would assume that all the resurrection appearances were in Galilee.  
But then, in Matthew, the women actually meet Jesus at the tomb, before the disciples see him in Galilee.  
Finally, in Luke and John, the disciples (and Mary Magdalene in John) only meet Jesus in (or near) Jerusalem. 

Excluding the obvious postscript of John 21 it would seem that, starting in Mark, 
Jerusalem gradually but completely replaces Galilee in resurrection encounters. 

Could this be a hint - as some have suggested **[citation needed]** - 
that Mark appropriated the Galilean resurrection stories within his main account? 

Alternatively - with the new-found significance of the empty-tomb in resurrection apologetics - 
it should not be surprising that Jerusalem based resurrection legends were now readily received,
e.g. the resurrected saints in Matthew 27:52-53. 


### Stylistic consistency

The preceding exploration not-with-standing, 
when reading or imagining the "postscript" it does feel stylistically consistent, with vivid scenes, dualisms,
frequent use of "and" to join sentences. 
It is easy to imagine the same author is also responsible.


## Predictions of death and resurrection.

Jesus predicts his death and / or resurrection several times.
(Perhaps surprisingly, the only time his burial is predicted is in the aforementioned "Anointing at Bethany".)
While the audience doubtless was familiar with Jesus being crucified and appearing afterward,
does it make sense for Mark to include the predictions and then only retell the crucifixion?
On the other hand, would an audience accept an empty tomb but no resurrection appearances 
as a satisfactory fulfillment to the very same play?

Let's look closer at these predictions while considering a few questions:
1. Is the prediction of resurrection consistent with Mark 15-16?
2. Could the prediction of the resurrection have been added later, perhaps initially from a border annotation? Does the text flow just as well without it?
3. Could the prediction of resurrection simply be liturgical, always accompanying the crucifixion, 
    perhaps following the precedent of 1 Corinthians 15:3-5?


### Mark 8:27-33
> And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi.  
And on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”  
And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”  
And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?”  
Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.”  
And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.  
And he began to teach them that  
> 
> **the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed,  
> and after three days rise again.**  
>
> And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 
But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said,  
“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”

Notwithstanding the second day resurrection, this prediction is not inconsistent with the canonical ending of Mark.
Certainly the proportions in detail of the suffering and condemnation versus the resurrection 
is a decent match for that presented in the final chapters of Mark. 

From our perspective it seems odd that Peter would rebuke Jesus for speaking about resurrection,
but naturally at this point in the story the disciples are dreaming of an earthly kingdom.

Unlike the 1 Corinthians 15 liturgy, the prediction does not include burial, 
nor does it explicitly include Jesus being seen by disciples.
(This sets a precedent for most of the rest of Mark and indeed all the gospels.)

This omission of burial feels a little surprising if the burial was an important part of the narrative before Mark was compiled. 
One might speculate that since the prediction of resurrection is so short it could be added after the proposed postscript became established. 
However, if it was added later, mightn't we also expect it to include a short "and buried"? 
Moreover, by the time Matthew is written there has been no urge to revise the prediction. 

Overall it feels like it is probably based on contemporary liturgy - 
especially as it is repeated - with adjustment - two more times in Mark.
The only earlier liturgy we know is that in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received:  
_(1a)_    that Christ died for our sins  
_(1b)_        in accordance with the Scriptures,  
_(1c)_           that he was buried,  
_(2a)_    that he was raised on the third day  
_(2b)_        in accordance with the Scriptures,  
_(2c)_             and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.

Whilst the prediction in Mark is clearly different, 
it could be argued that it is a decent match for the lines (1a and 2a) claimed to be in accordance with scripture. 

### Mark 9:30-35
> They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, because he was teaching his disciples.  
He said to them, 
> 
> **"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, 
> and after three days he will rise."**  
>
> But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.  
> And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”  
> But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.  
> And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, 
> “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.”

This feels much the same as the preceding prediction, 
but significantly it is immediately followed by a contrasting episode of 
the disciples arguing about relative importance. 

### Mark 10:32-45
> And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. 
And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. 
And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, saying,  
> 
> “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and  
> **the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. 
> And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him.  
> And after three days he will rise.”**  
>
> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” 
And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” 
Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” 
And they said to him, “We are able.” 
And Jesus said to them, 
“The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, 
but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 
And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. 
And Jesus called them to him and said to them, 
“You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 
But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 
and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. 
>
> **For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”**


This feels much the same as the earlier predictions, 
and once again is followed by disciples - this time explicitly James and John - petitioning for importance, 
thus revealing that they must presume Jesus's prediction is symbolic. 
This is of course consistent with their abandonment of Jesus when he is meekly arrested. 

These repeated examples of the disciples jockeying for position are highly suggestive 
that this was Peter's motivation when he initially rebuked Jesus. 

There is a second prediction of death in this excerpt 
where Jesus contrasts the mindset of the Son of Man with that of rulers of the world.  
Of all the predictions in Mark, this statement that he "gives his life as a ransom for many"  
comes the closest to the 1 Corinthians 15:3 statement that "Christ died for our sins". 

With such a strong focus that the world's (and the disciples) expectations of a Christ are wrong, 
it could be argued that Mark ending at 15:39 was completely appropriate to drive home this message. 
This wouldn't preclude having resurrection encounters, just not in the Passion play. 


### Mark 14:17-31
> And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. 
And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.” 
They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?” 
He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. 
For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! 
It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”
And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.” 
And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. 
And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. 
Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
And Jesus said to them,  
>
> “You will all fall away, for it is written,  
> **‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’  
> But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”**  
> 
> Peter said to him, “Even though they all fall away, I will not.” 
And Jesus said to him, “Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” 
But he said emphatically, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.


The prediction after the Last Supper adds the information that the disciples will desert Jesus but also encounter the resurrected Jesus in Galilee. 
This is echoed in the words of the young man at the empty tomb. 
Some might say this demonstrates a tell towards the empty tomb scene. 
Others might assert that it suggests there was going to be an ending in Galilee, much like Matthew 28. 
Alternatively, the sentence "But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee" 
doesn't break the flow of the text whether it is included or left out - it isn't impossible that it was a later addition.
(Bernard Muller notes that Peter's response is specific to the first part of Jesus's prediction - 
regarding the disciples falling away - but doesn't address the resurrection prediction at all - 
even though that also seems to include him. )

There is also the inference in Jesus's words in the Last Supper that Jesus will drink wine in the kingdom of God, 
although arguably this is just creative rewriting of 1 Corinthians 10:23-26. 


### Mark 9:1-13
> And he said to them,
“Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power.”
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And he was transfigured before them, and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them.
And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
And Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified.
And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son; listen to him.”
And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.
And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen,  
**until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.**  
So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean.
And they asked him, “Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?”
And he said to them, “Elijah does come first to restore all things.
And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.”

If any of canonical Mark is reminiscent of Papias's "unordered" Mark it is this passage. 
Is the prediction of some standing there seeing the kingdom of God coming in power immediately fulfilled in the transfiguration? Surely that doesn't make sense dramatically. 
Is the transfiguration meant to be a proof for Peter, James, and John (and the audience) that the future is guaranteed? c.f. 2 Peter 1:17,18  

Why are James and John in Mark 10 so forward about wanting status when it seems they have already been given it? 
Or could it be that this story began as a resurrection account as in Matthew 28:16 and was repurposed to be used into the main story? 
Certainly Matthew sees fit to have both the transfiguration and the great commissioning which presumably occurred on the same Holy mountain. 

Interestingly there is no prediction of the crucifixion here. 
The resurrection prediction feels neither liturgical nor like a side note which made its way into the text. 
The disciples reaction of "questioning what this rising from the dead might mean" does perhaps feel consistent 
with canonical Mark's ambiguous ending. 


### Hopeless disciples

Jesus not only predicts his own death and resurrection, but also the desertion of his disciples.
But implied in the predictions is that they aren't going to be left in their hopelessness.  

Of course, the audience could be expected to be familiar with the disciples continued role in the spreading of the Good News,
but did the author know how he was going to confirm those inferences when he included the predictions?
Perhaps the author was anticipating using a resurrection story which included the disciples - 
for example Jesus walking on the water, or even the transfiguration where Jesus is declared the Son of God.
**[citation needed]**

This essayist at least finds it implausible that there wasn't some contemporary (and perhaps non-authoritative) sequels to the Passion play
which contained accounts with restored disciples and perhaps resurrection encounters. 
After all, this work is titled "The **beginning** of the Good News ...". 

But if this theory is granted then it raises the question -
why did Mark go viral / become authoritative **without** any such sequels?


## Partially fulfilled predictions?

Let's assert that all the resurrection predictions were in the earliest form of Mark, whether liturgical or more intentional. 
Are they all consistent with the canonical ending, and if not, why not?

The predictions of resurrection (or even execution) are never accompanied by burial which might be surprising in the light of 1 Corinthians 15.
Could that be a hint that Mark was initially composed when the burial wasn't an essential part of contemporary retellings?

The resurrection (or at least the discovery of the empty tomb) does seem to be after two days rather than the three predicted in the liturgy. 
This could suggest that the empty tomb account wasn't coupled with the liturgy when Mark was composed.
It is sometimes argued that this is not inconsistent because it is "on the third day" if you count the day of death as day one. 
But given that this is explicitly fixed in John it does feel like an unintentional mismatch in Mark and the synoptics. 
The counter to this is that John wasn't fixing the timing, rather he wanted to present Jesus as the Passover lamb. (But why not both?)
**[citations needed]**

Still, the canonical ending of Mark has some general consistency with these predictions - 
it shows Jesus being killed, provides a symbol of resurrection, 
and repeats that the disciples will encounter Jesus in Galilee.  

Do the consistencies indicate that when the author wrote the predictions into the script he also knew he was going to fulfil them without appearances? 
Could he have originally assumed that the predictions themselves were satisfactory to imply the resurrection appearances after the gospel's climax? 
Or perhaps the Passion Week stories were retold before Easter and there were separate resurrection tellings after Easter.
Certainly the original audience would be familiar with some resurrection stories?
Indeed, the enhanced endings in the later gospels (and the longer endings of Mark) 
imply that within a few decades audiences weren't satisfied with even the inference supplied by the empty tomb
and were demanding more explicit accounts.
This is still the case in the modern era, with none less than Bruce Megzter opining that surely this wasn't the intended ending of Mark. **[citation needed]**  

Alternatively, could it be that what appears to be vaguely fulfilled predictions 
were actually meant to remind the audience that part of the fulfillment was yet to come,  
perhaps even in the original audiences own timeframe? 
Or lack of resurrection appearances might be giving permission to anyone to have an encounter with the resurrected Jesus. 

Or maybe the concept of resurrection itself was still under discussion?

## John's death, burial, and resurrection. 

Perhaps surprisingly, Jesus is not the only prophet to be executed, buried in a tomb, and have resurrection appearances. 

> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. 
Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
Others said, “He is Elijah.”
And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.”
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and 
...
he sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. 
...
On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
>
> -- <cite>Mark 16:14-29</cite>

Considering the potential comparisons between John's and Jesus's resurrections it is perhaps surprising that John's story is almost an afterthought. 
In fact the manifestation of the resurrected John the Baptist - that is Jesus's miracles - are presented before the account of John's death. 
At the very least this pericopae demonstrates that stories about resurrection did not need to be accompanied by an empty tomb. 
It is perhaps also indicative that the concept of resurrection was amorphous - maybe even flexible - in first century Judeo-Christian communities.
c.f. Josephus's descriptions of the range of Jewish belief's about the afterlife and the possible hints at transmigration or reincarnation. **[citation needed]**  

Certainly it isn't until Luke that we get a flesh-and-blood resurrected Jesus,
(or should we call it a heavenly-body, earthly-body fusion?)
and Luke still has the ambiguous account of the stranger on the road to Emmaus 
and, of course, the terse "appeared to Simon". 

By the time John's gospel is written it almost seems that christians are being pressured to get on board with this flesh-and-blood resurrection. 

> Now Thomas ... was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him,  
> “We have seen the Lord.”  
> But he said to them,  
> “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.”  
> 
> Eight days later ... Thomas was with them. ... Jesus came and stood among them and said,  
> “Peace be with you.”  
> Then he said to Thomas,  
> “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.” 
> Thomas answered him,  
> “My Lord and my God!”  
> Jesus said to him,  
> “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”
>
> -- <cite>John 20:24-29</cite>

Interpolating between the nature of resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15 and Matthew, Luke, and John, 
does this suggest the nature of resurrection was up for debate in Mark's time? 
If so, it wouldn't be surprising if this was a factor in why Mark doesn't include any resurrection encounters. 


## The evolution of Mark

None of the New Testament letters (or even the letters of the early church fathers) mention the tomb, 
yet starting with Mark, all the narrative gospels do. Indeed, the story becomes more embellished, 
presumably as critics or even christians begin to question its credibility. 

Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the burial and empty tomb narrative is a postscript, 
let us (wildly) speculate how might Mark have evolved?
We have no texts to work with - just like Q, the presumed proto-Mark is lost, or rather absorbed into the canonical gospels -
but we do have Eusebius's quote of Papias's hearsay that the Presbyter John claimed that Mark wrote an unordered collection of Peter's anecdotes on the life of Jesus. **[citation needed]**  
It seems reasonable that such a text would have some perceived authority, and it begins to be shared amongst a small network of christian communities.

After the fall of Jerusalem - and the temple - there is a faith crisis regarding the apparent invincibility of the Roman empire 
and the ongoing stresses on the christian communities. 
This is handled in various ways (including abandonment of faith) but the dominant apologetic is the Passion Week play, 
which draws on some of the proto-Mark material 
with the addition that it pits Jesus against the temple (which explains the temple's destruction)
and ends with a Roman centurion acknowledging that Jesus is a Son of God (a premonition of what will surely happen in the audience's time).
After a few years the play and some of the other stories from proto-Mark are assembled - perhaps by an acolyte of Mark - 
into a final written form of "the Good News of Jesus Christ the Son of God".

One Passover / Easter there is a novel addition to a performance of the Passion Week plays. 
Reminiscent of the Graeco-Roman trope of an empty tomb signifying a person has been taken up to the gods, 
in this scene some anonymous women are going to visit a tomb to mourn and inexplicably find it open. c.f. Robin Faith Walsh **[citation needed]**  
Perhaps the Passion week play had even been performed as a sequence of short plays in the week before Easter 
and then the empty tomb scene is really first performed on the first day of the week. 
The audience - mostly aware of the trope - understands the significance, and it feels like a satisfying epilogue.
Conveniently, it also doesn't preclude continuing the non-authoritative plays regarding resurrection encounters of the male disciples. 
After all, this is just "the beginning of the Good News ...". 

As this well received epilogue spreads in the small network it gets modified to make the links with the gospel stronger. 
Some new hearers assume it is intended to be historical and some apologetic reworking is applied - 
this requires making it flow on from the crucifixion scene (when they are performed together) and also some deanonymizing.  

<details>
<summary>On the women's names</summary>
In 1 Corinthians 15 there is a reference to "The Twelve" to whom Jesus appeared but no detail of who is included or even when they became known as such.
The gospels all claim that Jesus chose The Twelve and provide names, although these are not consistent and they even include Judas who obviously isn't in Paul's "The Twelve".
Amongst bible scholars there is some openness to the suggestion that several of those listed were in fact Jesus's brothers.
Surprisingly, Papias provides a shorter list of seven - Andrew, Peter, Philip, Thomas, James, John, Matthew.
The gospels also have inconsistency (and vagueness) amongst the lists of women who went to the tomb.
They all include Mary Magdalene, and the synoptics all include another Mary. They all have hints at other women.
Now if we look at Luke 23:55 he says it was "the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee"
and in Luke 24:10 he reports that "it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them".
If we look back at Luke 8:1-3 he notes that the female followers included Mary Magadelene, Joanna, Susanna, and others.
We could infer that Luke potentially has four named women at the empty tomb.
The only other female follower mentioned in the context of Jesus's tomb is Salome in Mark.
In total we seem to have the potential for five named women at the tomb.
Add that to Papias's seven male disciples and we have **twelve**.
This is probably just coincidence and obviously very tenuous,
but if Paul's "The Twelve" included women then it would not be astonishing
that some memory of it could leak into the empty tomb narrative
when the story tellers aren't happy with an initial anonymous account.  
Strongly against this theory would be that "The Twelve" are obviously reminiscent of the Twelve Tribes of Israel
and thus the twelve **sons** of Jacob.
</details>

By the time the epilogue arrives back at the community where the gospel had been first finalized 
it is close to fully formed and some people are arguing that it sounds credible and should be added to the gospel. 
Or maybe it is just the primitive form which has popular demand to be integrated into the script, 
and the original compiler reworks the ending several times until it reaches the current state. 

This then becomes the final version of Mark which goes viral thus forming the basis for what a gospel must include.


### Evolutionary artefacts in the postscript

The mismatches and other curiosities discovered in the preceding exploration could be evolutionary artefacts. 
Identifying these artefacts and postulating how they got into the text and then persisted 
will allow us to propose more detailed stages of development. 
Of course, it must be remembered that without manuscript evidence this is all speculation. 
Plus, sometimes script-writers just make mistakes - 
we have multi-million dollar movies with plot holes big enough to let a T-Rex escape through.

1. Joseph of Arimathea asks Pilate for the **body** of Jesus,  
    but after confirming (via the centurion) that Jesus was actually dead, Pilate grants him the **corpse**.
    A related account appears in John, but there is no matching detail in Matthew or Luke.
    **Postulate 1:** A very late revision introduces the verification that Jesus was actually dead on the day of crucifixion.
    This is the only time the centurion is included in the postscript.
2. The non-anonymous women who watch the crucifixion, observe the burial, and find the tomb empty, 
    are named three times, and this naming is inconsistent. It feels clumsy and later gospel authors seek to "fix" it. 
    This clunkiness disappears if the women are simply announced the once in the empty tomb scene. 
    Moreover, the young man redundantly tells the women to see where Jesus was laid 
    even though in the burial scene they already had seen where he was laid.  
    **Postulate 2:** The women were added to the burial scene in one of the revisions.  
3. The burial is performed by Joseph of Arimathea, and **he** (singular) rolls a stone in front of the tomb. 
    Yet the young man at the tomb tells the women to see where **they** (plural) laid Jesus's body. 
    This plural is consistent with Acts 13:29 where anonymous Jewish leaders bury Jesus. 
    It is also consistent with what would we expect - 
    if the concern is about leaving bodies up on the Sabbath then all of them would be taken down 
    and it wouldn't be a one-man task.  
    **Postulate 3:** In one of the revisions Joseph of Arimathea is swapped in for anonymous Jewish leaders 
    (who would have buried all the crucified men as implied in John). 
4. The arresting committee in the Garden of Gethsemane bizarrely chases an anonymous young man, and takes his linen cloth. 
    This incident doesn't flow with its context, and the burial scene - without Joseph of Arimathea - needs his linen cloth.  
    **Postulate 4:** In an earlier revision, the incident of the mob chasing the young man in a linen cloth 
    is incorporated into the burial scene and not the arrest scene.  
5. If the young man and his linen cloth was removed from the burial scene when Joseph of Arimathea was inserted, 
    then he was a theatrical device as was the linen cloth / shroud. Given this, his anonymity is unsurprising.  
    **Postulate 5:** In the earliest revisions there was no young man and no linen cloth / shroud.
6. If there is no young man at the empty-tomb then there is no-one to tell the women to go to Galilee to see the risen Jesus. 
    If they weren't told this at the empty tomb, then maybe Jesus didn't say it at the Last Supper. 
    The Last Supper scene flows better without this short postfix.  
    **Postulate 6:** In the original Last Supper scene Jesus did not tell his disciples that after he had risen he would go ahead of them to Galilee.
7. If the young man with the linen cloth was initially added as a link between burial and empty tomb scenes  
    then those two scenes were decoupled at first which implies one was added later.  
    In the burial scene (and not before) we find out that it is the Day of Preparation for the Sabbath. 
    According to the script this provides motivation for Jesus's body to be taken down from the cross. 
    This seems too convenient: 
    if the Jewish authorities were ok to arrest and try Jesus and have Pilate order his execution all on the Passover, 
    it hardly seems plausible that they will have qualms about a regular Sabbath. 
    The author of the gospel of John at least seems to feel the need to correct this.  
    Since almost all the identified anomalies seem to have the purpose of authenticating that Jesus's body went missing, 
    it seems reasonable to infer that the burial scene was added for this purpose too.  
    **Postulate 7:** The burial scene was added in one of the (early) revisions. 
8. In the anointing at Bethany, it seems implausible that where-ever the gospel is told this anonymous women would be honored if 
    there were known stories of the **named** women who intended to anoint Jesus body 
    and instead found what would become important evidence for the resurrection.  
    **Postulate 8a:** The women buying spices to anoint Jesus body was added in a revision.  
    **Postulate 8b:** In the earliest revision the women at the tomb were not named.  
    **Postulate 8c:** In the original version of Mark there was no empty tomb scene.  


### Stages of development

These are derived by attempting to resolve the purported evolutionary artefacts identified in the preceding analysis.

#### Stage 1

> Very early on the first day of the week
some women who had followed Jesus from Galilee
went to the tomb where Jesus was buried.
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back.  
And entering the tomb, they saw the place where he had been laid.  
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them.

#### Stage 2

> Since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,  
the scribes and elders asked Pilate for the bodies of Jesus and the others who had been crucified with him.  
And taking them down, they laid them in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.   
And they rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
>
> When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, 
who had followed Jesus from Galilee, 
bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.  
And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb.  
And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”  
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back.  
And entering the tomb, they saw the place where he had been laid.  
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them.

#### Stage 3

> Since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,  
the Jewish leaders asked Pilate for the bodies of Jesus and the others who had been crucified with him.  
And taking them down, they laid them in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.  
And a young man followed them, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body.
And they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.  
And they wrapped Jesus's body in the linen cloth,
and they rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
>
> When the Sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, who had followed Jesus from Galilee,
bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.  
And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb.
And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”  
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back.  
And entering the tomb, they saw the young man sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
And he said to them,  
“Why do you seek the living among the dead?  
He has risen; he is not here. See the linen cloth they wrapped him in.”  
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them.

#### Stage 4

> There were also women looking on from a distance,
among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him,
and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
>
> And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud
and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.  
> 
> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
>
> When the Sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, 
bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”  
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back.  
And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.
And he said to them,  
“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified.
He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.”  
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them.

Also, the young man running away is moved to Mark 14:51-52.

> And a young man followed them, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body.
And they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.

#### Stage 5 - Final

This will be nearly the same as our current form of Mark 15:40-16:8, merely excluding Mark 15:44-45. 
This is the same as the previous stage, except for Mark 16:6-8. 

> And he said to them,  
“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.
**But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.**”
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them,
**and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid**.

The matching prediction is added to Mark 14:27-28

> And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, for it is written,
‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
**But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.**”

#### Stage 6 - Late addition

This is the same as our current form of Mark 15:40-16:8. 
It finally adds Mark 15:44-45. 

> Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. 
> And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. 
> And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph.

### Anticipated manuscript evidence

Even though Mark established the template for narrative gospels,
we actually have less manuscripts for Mark than the later gospels. 
The situation is even more bleak for the well accepted sayings gospel, Q. 
Although it (presumably) was available to Clement of Rome (and the recipients of his letter),
not to mention the authors of Matthew and Luke, 
there are no manuscripts at all definitively establishing its historicity.
(Imagine how we would approach Matthew and Luke if Mark had similarly disappeared.)
How much less likely is it to find manuscript evidence for earlier drafts of the gospel of Mark? 

No matter, let us consider what forms of manuscript evidence would be supportive of an earlier Mark without the suggested postscript,
(ordered by approximate weight): 

- a fragment which ends at Mark 15:39. 
- a fragment of Mark 15 which does not contain the timestamps - the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour. 
- an ending of Mark which doesn't mention the women at the cross.
- a fragment of Mark 14 without v28 or v51. 
- an account of the Transfiguration or Jesus walking on the water which don't align with the gospels.
- early christian writings which indicate that Mark underwent revisions. 
    e.g. the Mar Saba letter, if found and accepted as plausibly Clementine, 
    would support an early belief that Mark's gospel underwent revision,
    even if it is unrelated to the topic of this essay.


## Conclusion

Since there is no manuscript evidence for earlier drafts of Mark, 
it must remain speculation whether one proposition for its evolution is more likely than another. 

This essay has identified arguments possibly in favour of Mark 15:39 being a satisfactory ending to an earlier draft of Mark:

- it is a climax of the gospel and the last explicit mention of Jesus as the Son of God, reflecting the gospel's title.   
- important characters in the remainder of the story were not introduced beforehand, 
    and are referenced relatively clumsily.  
- there are other mismatches and curiosities in burial and empty tomb scene which could be evolutionary artefacts.   
- one intention of Mark's gospel is to contrast Jesus with leaders of the world, and ending at the cross would highlight that.   
- the preceding accounts in the gospel may not anticipate the burial as recorded.  
- The accounts in later gospels show signs of ongoing controversy regarding the details of Mark's burial and resurrection.  

However, it has also been found that if Mark 15:40-16:8 were indeed a postscript, 
its addition may well have been accompanied by some revision of the previous gospel text:

- timestamps in Mark 15 - the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour.
- Jesus's prediction of the disciples seeing him in Galilee from Mark 14. 
- the young man fleeing naked in Mark 14.
