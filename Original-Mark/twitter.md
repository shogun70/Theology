# Unravelling the shorter ending of gMark

## Rambling about story development and plot holes

Writing a story, or producing a play or movie, are iterative processes. 

This process inevitably introduces mismatches 

## The young man (part 1)

In the gospel of Mark, are the young man who flees naked at Jesus arrest,
and the young man who is first to the empty tomb, the same individual?

----

There is the obvious similarity that they are both anonymous, young, men 
following Jesus around (alive or dead). 

> And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
... 
And they laid hands on him and seized him.  
...  
And they all left him and fled.  
And _a young man_ followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.  
And _they led Jesus to the high priest_.  
-- Mark 14:43-53

> And entering the tomb, they saw _a young man_ sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. 
And he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. _You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified_. 
He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.  
-- Mark 16:5-6

----

The association is stronger when we notice the "linen cloth" of the young man in the garden 
is equivalent to the "linen shroud" used to wrap Jesus body -  
in Greek it is *σινδόνα* / *σινδόνι* (sindona / sindoni). 

![Mark 14:51-52](./Mark_14-51.png)
![Mark 15:46](./Mark_15-46.png)

What is the author trying to hint at?

----

If we visualize the empty tomb scene, 
surely it also contains a linen shroud, pointed to by that anonymous young man?

> And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.  
And he said to them,
“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here.  
_See the place where they laid him. **[The young man gestures at a linen cloth]**_  

----

It seems reasonable to suggest this was an implied stage direction when Mark was dramatized, 
and that this was plausibly the origin for John and Luke's gospels including burial clothes in the empty tomb. 

>  Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 
And stooping to look in, _he saw the linen cloths lying there_, but he did not go in. 
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. _He saw the linen cloths lying there_.  
-- John 20:4-6

> But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, _he saw the linen cloths by themselves_; 
and he went home marveling at what had happened.  
-- Luke 24:12

----

Finally, it may be observed that the young man in Gethsemene enters the scene clothed and leaves naked,
while in the burial scene Jesus' body would be naked on the cross then clothed for entombment. 

> And they crucified him _and divided his garments among them_, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.  
-- Mark 15:24

----

This foreshadowing is clear-cut when these vignettes are visualised and juxtaposed. 

> And immediately ... Judas came ... and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.  
...  
And they laid hands on him [Jesus] and seized him.  
And they [the disciples] all left him and fled.  
>  
> And _a young man_ followed him, _with nothing but a linen cloth about his body_. 
And they [the mob] seized him, but _he left the linen cloth and ran away naked_.  

> _And they crucified him [naked]_ and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.

> And Joseph bought a linen shroud, 
and _taking him down [naked], wrapped him in the linen shroud_
and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. 
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

> And entering the tomb, _they [the women] saw a young man sitting on the right side_, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.  
And he said to them,
“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here.  
_See the place where they laid him. **[The young man gestures at a linen cloth]**_

----

But this foreshadowing had apparently been confusing for later audiences 
since none of the later gospels retain the incident of the young man fleeing the arrest scene.  

Later authors applied the principle of Chekhov's gun.

> If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. 
Otherwise don't put it there.

----

And yet it must be presumed Mark's initial audience recognized the link.  

One explanation for this in-group cognition is that Mark's audience 
**had already seen a dramatization where** 
the young man fleeing naked **actually occurs in the burial scene**.

What are the pros and cons of such a proposal? 

----

The young man's cameo in the arrest scene is:

1. inessential - the scene flows as well or better without his part.
2. irrational - why would the mob chase him instead of the disciples?
3. confusing - later gospel authors remove it, commentators look for symbolic meaning.

----

Conversely, if the young man's role was originally part of the burial scene, it would be:

1. an unambiguous connection with the empty tomb.
2. an essential role, if his linen cloth became Jesus burial garment.

----

Intriguingly there are possible vestiges of an earlier account of the burial story

- in a speech by Paul in Acts where **anonymous Jewish leaders** bury Jesus.
- in Mark's empty tomb scene where the young man says "see the place where **they** laid him".

Juxtaposing these snippets reveals a potential consistency.

> For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, 
because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, 
fulfilled them by condemning him. 
And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, _**they** asked Pilate to have him executed_. 
And when **they** had carried out all that was written of him, 
_**they** took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb_.  
-- Acts 13:27-29

> And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. 
_And **they** seized him_, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.  
-- Mark 14:51-52

> And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.  
And he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. 
_See the place where **they** laid him_.  
-- Mark 16:5-6

----

The main argument against this proposal
(apart from no manuscript evidence)
is it almost necessitates a model of development for the gospel 
whereby the burial and empty tomb scenes are an evolving postscript 
while the rest of the gospel is stable. 

If the gospel originally ends before the burial 
then it significantly changes the **purpose** of the gospel.  

How would our current ending be accepted into such a gospel?

----

Now a gospel postscript is not an alien concept,
and some scholars are open to John 21 and Luke 1-2 being later additions.  

In fact there is an undisputed postscript in the longer ending of Mark, 
a similar scenario to this proposal, with the exceptions that:

- the longer ending seems to be obviously integrating already accepted details from other gospels.
- the longer ending did not erase the canonical ending from the manuscript record.

## Mary, Mary, and Salome

In the burial and empty tomb scenes of gMark there are (much discussed) mismatches between the different repetitions of the named female followers.
One proposed explanation is that this occurred during revision of an earlier form of the story. 
How would the story have read pre-revision,  
and what purpose did the revision serve? 
This thread will attempt to reconstruct this. 

> There were also women looking on from a distance,  
among whom were **Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome**.  
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him.  
And there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.  
> ...  
> **Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses** saw where he was laid.  
>   
> When the Sabbath was past, **Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome** bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.

---- 

Reconstruction #1

What happens if we simply remove the mismatches?

> There were also women looking on from a distance,  
among whom were **Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome**.  
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him.  
And there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.  
>  
> And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,  
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead,
he granted the corpse to Joseph.  
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down,
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
>  
> <del>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.  
**When the Sabbath was past**, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome **bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him**.</del>  

----

It is apparent that the mismatches **align** with the section where the women's visit to the tomb is given a **purpose**:
"that they might go and anoint him". 

So why didn't they go to the tomb on the very next day? 
That too is explained - because it was the Sabbath. 

So why didn't they anoint him immediately? 
Again this is justified - they had to go and buy spices.

This section also highlights another subtle mismatch:
Joseph of Arimathea was able to buy a shroud as soon as he was granted the corpse.
Why hadn't the women also bought their spices? They had the whole crucifixion day.  

----

Irrespective of the exact details, it is clear the **motivation** for this revision was **apologetic**. 

Reconstruction #2

Since the burial being on the Day of Preparation for the Sabbath is also required to prevent the women anointing the corpse immediately,
that detail too would have been introduced in this revision step.

> **There were also women looking on from a distance**,  
among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.  
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him.  
And there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
>
> <del>And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</del>
>
> Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead,
he granted the corpse to Joseph.  
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down,
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
>
> And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, **they went to the tomb**.

----

Now clearly this reading doesn't work - 
the "they" in "**they** went to the tomb" is too far removed from the previous reference to the women. 

Reconstruction #3

However, if we take the text introducing the women, and simply move it from before the burial to afterwards,
it flows seamlessly with both the burial scene and the empty tomb scene. 

> Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead,
he granted the corpse to Joseph.  
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down,
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.  
>
> <ins>There were also women looking on from a distance,  
among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.  
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him.  
And there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</ins>
>  
> And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.

----

But now it can be seen that Mary, Mary, and Salome were not the only women to attend the tomb.   

They were redundant to the pre-revision story, but were introduced to address the unwieldiness of having many women:
- watch from a distance
- observe the entombment
- buy spices
- return to the tomb for the anointing.

----

Final reconstruction

> Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead,
he granted the corpse to Joseph.  
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down,
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
>

<del>among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</del>

<del>And there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</del>
>
> And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.


----

In summary, this revision step introduced:

- anointing with spices, as a reason to return to the tomb on the first day of the week.
- the Day of Preparation for the Sabbath, as a reason the women could not anoint the body immediately.
- Mary, Mary, and Salome, essentially as pragmatic stage management.  

----

The pros of this revision explanation are:

- it had one goal - to justify some women attending the tomb on the first day of the week. 
- it completely explains the mismatches in the repetitions of the named women.
- it also explains the mismatch in Joseph being able to buy a shroud but the women not being able to buy spices. 

----

The cons are that:
- this very specific revision almost necessitates that 
  the burial and empty tomb scenes were evolving in a standalone script while the rest of gMark was essentially stable.  
- But also that the postscript was appended to gMark without anyone bothering to fix the obvious mismatches. 
- And also that the postscript would obviously significantly change the purpose of gMark - how did it get accepted?
