    <blockquote class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
        <pre>
My theory, then, is that canonical Mark dismembered <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>'s story of the young man's resurrection and initiation</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
Thus, for example, the “tomb” in Mark 16:2, 3, 5, 8 comes from the “tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 1v26; 2rl, 2, 6;
“who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb” in Mark 16:3
comes from “rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r1–2;
and, especially, the “young man” in the tomb in Mark 16:5 comes from the “young man” in the tomb in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r3,4,6. </pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But that raises a question I did not realize earlier.
When you remove those elements, what is actually left for a conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>?
...
Did <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> conclude with any story about finding the empty tomb?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
The obvious answer is that of course it did. There are still the women.
But now I notice a curious coincidence that I missed before. 
There are three women identified in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r14–16 as “the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome”.
There are also three women mentioned in Mark 15:40 as “Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome”
...
Is that too much coincidence?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
I think that, once again, canonical Mark has simply relocated the textual debris of a censored incident from <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.
...
The three women were not, any more than the young man in the tomb, part of the conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.</pre>

...
<em style="color: green">My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</em>
...
I realize, of course, that such a claim lacks any external or manuscript evidence
unless one retrojects the fact that redoing the ending of Mark became a small industry in the early church.
The evidence for it is internal and circumstantial, tentative, hypothetical, and clearly controversial.</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down"><u class="red-highlight">
But it fits very well with a Markan theology in which faith and hope despite persecution and death
is much more important than visions, apparitions and even revelations.

<blockquote class="fragment fade-down">
    <pre>
List of the clues suggesting Mark 15:40-16:8 as being an early interpolation:
A) "After three days" not matching the forty hours:
B) Peter as not one of the disciples:
C) Jesus is already anointed for burial (prior to his arrest):
D) The 'empty tomb' passage starts by "retroactive" "data":
E) Naming of women:
F) The parable of the tenants does not foresee Jesus' "honorable" burial:
G) The verse before the 'empty tomb' seems well-suited for a gospel ending, more so relative to a Gentile audience under Roman rule:

    </pre>

    <pre class="fragment fade-down">

In view of the aforementioned points (foremost the first one), I think there is more than enough for claiming "Mark" did not write the 'empty tomb' passage.
Then considering, in order to "prove" Jesus' resurrection, "Mark" relied only on:
a) the (alleged) prophecies about it by Jesus himself (as in 8:31, 9:31, 10:34), combined with he being an excellent prophet (even predicting the fall of Jerusalem!).
b) the alleged prior resurrection of a biblical notable: Moses' one, "proven" in 9:2-8.
c) little else, except for the testimony of Paul (1 Corinthians 9:1) and likely other "apostles in Christ", claiming to have "seen" the heavenly Jesus in some way.
It makes sense an early editor/interpolator (probably the first one) felt more was needed, more so in term of physical direct "evidence".
However, a bodily reappearance was not dared going for: that will be done later by others and added on to gMark.

King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known.

But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and ... he sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head.

On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

    The resurrection is an afterthought in Mark (even including the proposed postscript).
    Mark isn't trying to convince his audience that Jesus is the Son of God - he isn't writing that they may believe.

        <p>Moreover, this reason is doubly invalidated because Jesus was already anointed for burial in Bethany -

And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate.

And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
<b class="red-highlight">And it was the third hour</b> when they crucified him.
...
<b class="fragment">And when the sixth hour had come</b>, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<b class="fragment">And at the ninth hour</b> Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”
...
And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said,
“Truly this man was the Son of God!”
...
<b class="red-highlight">And when evening had come</b>, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea ...
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
    </pre></blockquote>
    <p>Once you see the pattern it is hard not to think that the timestamps were deliberately included to mark out a <b>whole</b> day, including the burial. <br />
    Doesn't that rule out the proposed postscript? <br />
    Maybe, but it could have been coincidence. Or the pattern could have been enhanced with some late additions into Mark 15.

        In contrast, Joseph's role in burying Jesus in a tomb seems stable, despite some variation in who he actually was.</p>
    <blockquote class="fragment"><pre>
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus... And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
    </pre><cite>-- Mark 15:43-46</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote class="fragment"><pre>
As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
    </pre><cite>-- Matthew 27:57-59</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote class="fragment"><pre>
Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body.
Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.
    </pre><cite>-- Luke 23:50-53</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote class="fragment"><pre>
Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down... But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead...
Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders.
With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away. ... Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.
At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
    </pre><cite>-- John 19:31-42</cite></blockquote>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>That Joseph's role is stable and his personal details are reasonably consistent
            seems to be strong evidence that he was a known historical figure -
            why would you need to say that a made up (or relatively unknown) character was actually a "secret disciple" of Jesus?</p>

    <p>
        If we read the New Testament chronologically according to when it was written,
        this is the first occasion where it was recorded that the earthly Jesus even had female followers.
    </p>
    <p>There are a few stories about anonymous women who were dignified by Jesus:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the women healed of bleeding</li>
        <li>the Syrophoenician woman praised for faith</li>
        <li>the women who anoints Jesus at Bethany</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why aren't there any stories of honor for these most faithful of Jesus's followers?</p>
    <p>New information could point to inherent inconsistency.</p>
    <p>Or is this insider knowledge, like the Messianic Secret?</p>
    <p>How do the other gospels treat the female followers?</p>

    <h2>The young man and his linen smock</h2>
    <p>Is the young man in a white robe at the empty tomb
        the same as the young man who loses his linen cloth when Jesus is arrested?
        It feels like he must be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The young man following Jesus is wearing a linen cloth.</li>
        <li>Jesus is wrapped in a linen cloth and buried in a tomb.</li>
        <li>A young man is at the same tomb when the women find the body of Jesus is gone.</li>
        <li>The young man fled naked - Jesus would have been crucified naked.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It feels like an example of <b class="red-highlight">Chekhov's gun</b> somehow.</p>
    <blockquote>
<pre style="color: green; font-size: 1em;">
Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first act that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third act it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But given that none of the later gospels retain this story - and given the numerous theories trying to explain it -
        it seems to be a link which Mark's contemporaries understood but quickly became confusing for later audiences.</p>

    <p>If it is the same man then surely that confirms Mark was thinking about the empty tomb when he wrote the arrest scene? </p>
    <p>Perhaps, but it is a strange tangent to the scene we find it in - it isn't impossible that it was inserted after the postscript was written.
        (Movies and plays will tweak earlier scenes when later scenes require it.)</p>

And they were saying to one another,
“Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — it was very large.
And entering the tomb, they saw
that the body of Jesus was missing.
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them.

    <h2>Anticipated Manuscript Evidence</h2>
    <p>Less manuscripts for Mark than the later gospels.<br />
        No manuscripts definitively establishing the existence of the well accepted sayings gospel, Q.<br />
        How much less likely is it to find manuscript evidence for earlier drafts of the gospel of Mark?</p>
    <p>No matter, let us consider what forms of manuscript evidence would be supportive of an earlier Mark without the suggested postscript,
        (ordered by approximate weight):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a fragment which ends at Mark 15:39.</li>
        <li>a fragment of Mark 15 which does not contain the timestamps - the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour.</li>
        <li>an ending of Mark which doesn't mention the women at the cross.</li>
        <li>a fragment of Mark 14 without v28 or v51.</li>
        <li>an account of the Transfiguration or Jesus walking on the water which don't align with the gospels.</li>
        <li>early christian writings which indicate that Mark underwent revisions.
            e.g. the Mar Saba letter, if found and accepted as plausibly Clementine,
            would support an early belief that Mark's gospel underwent revision.</li>

<section id="locality-of-appearances">
    <h2>Location of appearances</h2>
    <p>Mark foreshadows that Jesus resurrection encounters will be for the disciples (and the women?) in Galilee.</p>
    <p>Matthew actually shows the disciples seeing Jesus in Galilee.
    But the resurrection action is actually weighted towards Jerusalem: the women meet Jesus; saints are resurrected; tomb guards witness angels and Jesus meeting the women.</p>
    <p>Luke modifies Jesus's words so that the encounters are foreshadowed for Jerusalem, and all the encounters are in or near Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>John similarly has resurrection encounters in Jerusalem with the exception of the likely postscript of John 21.</p>
