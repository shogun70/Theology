<pre style="color: green; font-size: 1em;">
    My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</pre>

<cite>-- THE HISTORICAL JESUS, THE LIFE OF A MEDITERRANEAN PEASANT, Part III "Brokerless Kingdom", <wbr />Chapter 15 "Resurrection and Authority", Page 415</cite>

</blockquote>

    <h3 class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">Secret Mark?</h3>
    <blockquote class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
        <pre>My theory, then, is that canonical Mark dismembered <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>'s story of the young man's resurrection and initiation</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
Thus, for example, the “tomb” in Mark 16:2, 3, 5, 8 comes from the “tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 1v26; 2rl, 2, 6;
“who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb” in Mark 16:3
comes from “rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r1–2;
and, especially, the “young man” in the tomb in Mark 16:5 comes from the “young man” in the tomb in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r3,4,6. </pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But that raises a question I did not realize earlier.
When you remove those elements, what is actually left for a conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>?
...
Did <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> conclude with any story about finding the empty tomb?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
The obvious answer is that of course it did. There are still the women.
But now I notice a curious coincidence that I missed before. 
There are three women identified in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r14–16 as “the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome”.
There are also three women mentioned in Mark 15:40 as “Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome”
...
Is that too much coincidence?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
I think that, once again, canonical Mark has simply relocated the textual debris of a censored incident from <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.
...
The three women were not, any more than the young man in the tomb, part of the conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.</pre>
            <p style="color: green;">
            </p>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
...
<em style="color: green">My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</em>
...
I realize, of course, that such a claim lacks any external or manuscript evidence
unless one retrojects the fact that redoing the ending of Mark became a small industry in the early church.
The evidence for it is internal and circumstantial, tentative, hypothetical, and clearly controversial.</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down"><u class="red-highlight">
But it fits very well with a Markan theology in which faith and hope despite persecution and death
is much more important than visions, apparitions and even revelations.

    </a>

<blockquote class="fragment fade-down">
    <pre>List of the clues suggesting Mark 15:40-16:8 as being an early interpolation:
A) "After three days" not matching the forty hours:
B) Peter as not one of the disciples:
C) Jesus is already anointed for burial (prior to his arrest):
D) The 'empty tomb' passage starts by "retroactive" "data":
E) Naming of women:
F) The parable of the tenants does not foresee Jesus' "honorable" burial:
G) The verse before the 'empty tomb' seems well-suited for a gospel ending, more so relative to a Gentile audience under Roman rule:</pre>


    <pre class="fragment fade-down">

In view of the aforementioned points (foremost the first one), I think there is more than enough for claiming "Mark" did not write the 'empty tomb' passage.
Then considering, in order to "prove" Jesus' resurrection, "Mark" relied only on:
a) the (alleged) prophecies about it by Jesus himself (as in 8:31, 9:31, 10:34), combined with he being an excellent prophet (even predicting the fall of Jerusalem!).
b) the alleged prior resurrection of a biblical notable: Moses' one, "proven" in 9:2-8.
c) little else, except for the testimony of Paul (1 Corinthians 9:1) and likely other "apostles in Christ", claiming to have "seen" the heavenly Jesus in some way.
It makes sense an early editor/interpolator (probably the first one) felt more was needed, more so in term of physical direct "evidence".
However, a bodily reappearance was not dared going for: that will be done later by others and added on to gMark.</pre>

    <small>Jesus isn't even the first prophet in Mark to be linked with forgiveness of sins,
    to be arrested and executed, to be buried in a tomb, and to have rumors of resurrection.
    (And after he died his movement continued to spread and his institution of water baptism still persists.)</small>
    <blockquote>
    <pre>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known.
Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
Others said, “He is Elijah.” ...
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and ... he sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head...
On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</pre>

    <p class="fragment"><small>We find this surprising because we are looking backwards through the later gospels which included resurrection encounters.
        Mark's first audiences were perfectly fine not having those encounters <b>in their Passion play</b>.</small></p>

    The resurrection is an afterthought in Mark (even including the proposed postscript).
    Mark isn't trying to convince his audience that Jesus is the Son of God - he isn't writing <b class="green-highlight">that they may believe</b>.
    Mark is reminding his audience how <b class="red-highlight">a true Messiah saves the world, beginning a new age</b>.</small></p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> It had become traditional to have a strong separation between Jesus's suffering and the hope of resurrection.
Perhaps originally the Markan community was recounting only the former before Passover and the latter only after.

    <h2>Anticipated Manuscript Evidence</h2>
    <p>Less manuscripts for Mark than the later gospels.<br />
        No manuscripts definitively establishing the existence of the well accepted sayings gospel, Q.<br />
        How much less likely is it to find manuscript evidence for earlier drafts of the gospel of Mark?</p>
    <p>No matter, let us consider what forms of manuscript evidence would be supportive of an earlier Mark without the suggested postscript,
        (ordered by approximate weight):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a fragment which ends at Mark 15:39.</li>
        <li>a fragment of Mark 15 which does not contain the timestamps - the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour.</li>
        <li>an ending of Mark which doesn't mention the women at the cross.</li>
        <li>a fragment of Mark 14 without v28 or v51.</li>
        <li>an account of the Transfiguration or Jesus walking on the water which don't align with the gospels.</li>
        <li>early christian writings which indicate that Mark underwent revisions.
            e.g. the Mar Saba letter, if found and accepted as plausibly Clementine,
            would support an early belief that Mark's gospel underwent revision.</li>

    <h2>Location of appearances</h2>
    <p>Mark foreshadows that Jesus resurrection encounters will be for the disciples (and the women?) in Galilee.</p>
    <p>Matthew actually shows the disciples seeing Jesus in Galilee.
    But the resurrection action is actually weighted towards Jerusalem: the women meet Jesus; saints are resurrected; tomb guards witness angels and Jesus meeting the women.</p>
    <p>Luke modifies Jesus's words so that the encounters are foreshadowed for Jerusalem, and all the encounters are in or near Jerusalem.</p>
