    My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</pre>

    <h3 class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">Secret Mark?</h3>
    <blockquote class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
        <pre>My theory, then, is that canonical Mark dismembered <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>'s story of the young man's resurrection and initiation</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
Thus, for example, the “tomb” in Mark 16:2, 3, 5, 8 comes from the “tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 1v26; 2rl, 2, 6;
“who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb” in Mark 16:3
comes from “rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r1–2;
and, especially, the “young man” in the tomb in Mark 16:5 comes from the “young man” in the tomb in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r3,4,6. </pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But that raises a question I did not realize earlier.
When you remove those elements, what is actually left for a conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>?
...
Did <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> conclude with any story about finding the empty tomb?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
The obvious answer is that of course it did. There are still the women.
But now I notice a curious coincidence that I missed before. 
There are three women identified in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r14–16 as “the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome”.
There are also three women mentioned in Mark 15:40 as “Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome”
...
Is that too much coincidence?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
I think that, once again, canonical Mark has simply relocated the textual debris of a censored incident from <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.
...
The three women were not, any more than the young man in the tomb, part of the conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.</pre>
            <p style="color: green;">
            </p>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
...
<em style="color: green">My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</em>
...
I realize, of course, that <u class="green-highlight">such a claim lacks any external or manuscript evidence
            unless one retrojects the fact that redoing the ending of Mark became a small industry in the early church</u>.
The evidence for it is internal and circumstantial, tentative, hypothetical, and clearly controversial.</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down"><u class="red-highlight">
But it fits very well with a Markan theology in which faith and hope despite persecution and death
is much more important than visions, apparitions and even revelations.

    </a>

<blockquote class="fragment fade-down">
    <pre>List of the clues suggesting Mark 15:40-16:8 as being an early interpolation:
A) "After three days" not matching the forty hours:
B) Peter as not one of the disciples:
C) Jesus is already anointed for burial (prior to his arrest):
D) The 'empty tomb' passage starts by "retroactive" "data":
E) Naming of women:
F) The parable of the tenants does not foresee Jesus' "honorable" burial:
G) The verse before the 'empty tomb' seems well-suited for a gospel ending, more so relative to a Gentile audience under Roman rule:</pre>


    <pre class="fragment fade-down">

In view of the aforementioned points (foremost the first one), I think there is more than enough for claiming "Mark" did not write the 'empty tomb' passage.
Then considering, in order to "prove" Jesus' resurrection, "Mark" relied only on:
a) the (alleged) prophecies about it by Jesus himself (as in 8:31, 9:31, 10:34), combined with he being an excellent prophet (even predicting the fall of Jerusalem!).
b) the alleged prior resurrection of a biblical notable: Moses' one, "proven" in 9:2-8.
c) little else, except for the testimony of Paul (1 Corinthians 9:1) and likely other "apostles in Christ", claiming to have "seen" the heavenly Jesus in some way.
It makes sense an early editor/interpolator (probably the first one) felt more was needed, more so in term of physical direct "evidence".
However, a bodily reappearance was not dared going for: that will be done later by others and added on to gMark.</pre>

that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.</q>

    <small>Jesus isn't even the first prophet in Mark to be linked with forgiveness of sins,
    to be arrested and executed, to be buried in a tomb, and to have rumors of resurrection.
    (And after he died his movement continued to spread and his institution of water baptism still persists.)</small>
    <blockquote>
    <pre>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known.
Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
Others said, “He is Elijah.” ...
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and ... he sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head...
On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</pre>

    <h3 class="fragment">despite not including resurrection appearances?</h3>

    <p class="fragment"><small>We find this surprising because we are looking backwards through the later gospels which included resurrection encounters.
        Mark's first audiences were perfectly fine not having those encounters <b>in their Passion play</b>.</small></p>
    <p class="fragment"><small>
    The resurrection is an afterthought in Mark (even including the proposed postscript).
    Mark isn't trying to convince his audience that Jesus is the Son of God - he isn't writing <b class="green-highlight">that they may believe</b>.
    Mark is reminding his audience how <b class="red-highlight">a true Messiah saves the world, beginning a new age</b>.</small></p>

    <div class="fragment">
    <p>
<b>Conjecture:</b> It had become traditional to have a strong separation between Jesus's suffering and the hope of resurrection.
Perhaps originally the Markan community was recounting only the former before Passover and the latter only after.

        <cite>-- Mark 15:43-46</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote class="fragment"><pre>When it was evening, there came <u class="red-highlight">a rich man from Arimathea</u>, named Joseph, who also was <u class="red-highlight">a disciple of Jesus</u>. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
        And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and laid it in <u class="green-highlight">his own new tomb</u>, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. </pre>

    <ul class="fragment">
        <li>A popular explanation for John setting the crucifixion <u>before Passover</u> is to portray Jesus as the Passover Lamb.</li>
        <li class="fragment">But John changes several aspects of the burial scene, seemingly out of concern for plausibility:
            <ul class="fragment">
            <li><b>all</b> the crucifixion victims are taken down, at the instigation of the Jewish leaders</li>
            <li class="fragment">crucifixion victims would normally need some assistance to die the same day <small>(actually Mark does infer this)</small></li>

        </li>
        <li class="fragment">And there is good reason to place the crucifixion <u>before Passover</u>: <br />
            it hardly seems plausible that on the sacred Passover night and day the religious men on the council would: <br />
            hold a trial;
            condemn a man to death;
            harangue Pilate into a public execution.</li>

    <p class="fragment">The proposed revision history is derived entirely from existing texts. <br />

        No manuscripts definitively establishing the existence of the well accepted sayings gospel.<br />

        (ordered by approximate weight):</p>
    <ul class="fragment">
        <li>a fragment which ends at Mark 15:39.</li>
        <li class="fragment">a fragment of Mark 15 which does not contain the timestamps - the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour.</li>
        <li class="fragment">an ending of Mark which doesn't mention the women at the cross.</li>

    <h2>Resurrection before the gospels</h2>
    <div class="fragment">
        <h3>Paul - 1 Corinthians 15</h3>
        <blockquote><pre>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body...
“The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit...
Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven...
<b class="red-highlight">flesh and blood</b> cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</pre>
</blockquote>
        <div class="fragment">
        <p>But some Corinthian christians seem to dispute Paul's version of resurrection:</p>
        <blockquote><pre>How can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? ...
But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?”</pre>
</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="fragment">
        <p>Paul thinks that will inevitably lead to immorality:</p>
        <blockquote><pre>If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” ...
Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning.</pre>

        <h3>John the Baptist</h3>
        <p>The miracles of Jesus are a sign of John's resurrection. (spiritual energy?)</p>
        <blockquote><pre>King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.” ...
When Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”</pre>
        <cite>-- Mark 6:14-16</cite></blockquote>
        <div class="fragment">
            <p>Luke seems unable to grasp or unwilling to accept this concept.</p>
            <blockquote><pre>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead...
Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?”</pre>

            Historians seem to be in disagreement whether Josephus is reliable regarding religious beliefs,
            but the inescapable conclusion is that there is debate and a range of theories,

and to the souls of the wicked, the region of the ungodly in Hades ...
which is built on this first supposition, that souls are immortal;
and thence are those exhortations to virtue, and dehortations from wickedness collected;
whereby good men are bettered in the conduct of their life by the hope they have of reward after their death,
and whereby the vehement inclinations of bad men to vice are restrained,
by the fear and expectation ... that ... they should suffer immortal punishment after their death.</pre>

Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
