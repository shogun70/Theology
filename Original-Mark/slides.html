    <h3 class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">Secret Mark?</h3>
    <blockquote class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
        <pre>
My theory, then, is that canonical Mark dismembered <strong>Secret Mark</strong>'s story of the young man's resurrection and initiation</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
Thus, for example, the “tomb” in Mark 16:2, 3, 5, 8 comes from the “tomb” in <strong>Secret Mark</strong> 1v26; 2rl, 2, 6;
“who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb” in Mark 16:3
comes from “rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb” in <strong>Secret Mark</strong> 2r1–2;
and, especially, the “young man” in the tomb in Mark 16:5 comes from the “young man” in the tomb in <strong>Secret Mark</strong> 2r3,4,6. </pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But that raises a question I did not realize earlier.
When you remove those elements, what is actually left for a conclusion to <strong>Secret Mark</strong>?
...
Did <strong>Secret Mark</strong> conclude with any story about finding the empty tomb?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
The obvious answer is that of course it did. There are still the women.
But now I notice a curious coincidence that I missed before. 
There are three women identified in <strong>Secret Mark</strong> 2r14–16 as “the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome”.
There are also three women mentioned in Mark 15:40 as “Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome”
...
Is that too much coincidence?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
I think that, once again, canonical Mark has simply relocated the textual debris of a censored incident from <strong>Secret Mark</strong>.
...
The three women were not, any more than the young man in the tomb, part of the conclusion to <strong>Secret Mark</strong>.</pre>
            <p style="color: green;">
            </p>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
...
<em style="color: green">My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</em>
...
I realize, of course, that such a claim lacks any external or manuscript evidence
unless one retrojects the fact that redoing the ending of Mark became a small industry in the early church.
The evidence for it is internal and circumstantial, tentative, hypothetical, and clearly controversial.</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But it fits very well with a Markan theology in which faith and hope despite persecution and death
is much more important than visions, apparitions and even revelations.

    <h2>Who wrote the 'empty tomb' passage in Mark's gospel?</h2>

    <cite>-- Bernard Muller</cite>
<blockquote class="fragment">
    <pre class="fragment">
List of the clues suggesting Mark 15:40-16:8 as being an early interpolation:
A) "After three days" not matching the forty hours:
B) Peter as not one of the disciples:
C) Jesus is already anointed for burial (prior to his arrest):
D) The 'empty tomb' passage starts by "retroactive" "data":
E) Naming of women:
F) The parable of the tenants does not foresee Jesus' "honorable" burial:
G) The verse before the 'empty tomb' seems well-suited for a gospel ending, more so relative to a Gentile audience under Roman rule:

    </pre>

    <pre class="fragment">

In view of the aforementioned points (foremost the first one), I think there is more than enough for claiming "Mark" did not write the 'empty tomb' passage.
Then considering, in order to "prove" Jesus' resurrection, "Mark" relied only on:
a) the (alleged) prophecies about it by Jesus himself (as in 8:31, 9:31, 10:34), combined with he being an excellent prophet (even predicting the fall of Jerusalem!).
b) the alleged prior resurrection of a biblical notable: Moses' one, "proven" in 9:2-8.
c) little else, except for the testimony of Paul (1 Corinthians 9:1) and likely other "apostles in Christ", claiming to have "seen" the heavenly Jesus in some way.
It makes sense an early editor/interpolator (probably the first one) felt more was needed, more so in term of physical direct "evidence".
However, a bodily reappearance was not dared going for: that will be done later by others and added on to gMark.

    <p>There is an implied stage direction with the young man in the tomb gesturing to a linen cloth when he says "See where they laid him."</p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>
There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were
Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him,
and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead,
he granted the corpse to Joseph.
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down,
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

When the Sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome
bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
And they were saying to one another,
“Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — it was very large.
And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.
And he said to them,
“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.

And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them,
