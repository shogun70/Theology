<pre style="color: green; font-size: 1em;">
    My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</pre>

    <h3 class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">Secret Mark?</h3>
    <blockquote class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
        <pre>My theory, then, is that canonical Mark dismembered <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>'s story of the young man's resurrection and initiation</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
Thus, for example, the “tomb” in Mark 16:2, 3, 5, 8 comes from the “tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 1v26; 2rl, 2, 6;
“who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb” in Mark 16:3
comes from “rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r1–2;
and, especially, the “young man” in the tomb in Mark 16:5 comes from the “young man” in the tomb in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r3,4,6. </pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But that raises a question I did not realize earlier.
When you remove those elements, what is actually left for a conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>?
...
Did <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> conclude with any story about finding the empty tomb?
The obvious answer is that of course it did. There are still the women.</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But now I notice a curious coincidence that I missed before.
There are three women identified in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r14–16 as “the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome”.
There are also three women mentioned in Mark 15:40 as “Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome”
...
Is that too much coincidence?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
I think that, once again, canonical Mark has simply relocated the textual debris of a censored incident from <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.
...
The three women were not, any more than the young man in the tomb, part of the conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.</pre>
            <p style="color: green;">
            </p>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
...
<em style="color: green">My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</em>
...
I realize, of course, that <u class="green-highlight">such a claim lacks any external or manuscript evidence
unless one retrojects the fact that redoing the ending of Mark became a small industry in the early church</u>.
The evidence for it is internal and circumstantial, tentative, hypothetical, and clearly controversial.</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down"><u class="red-highlight">
But it fits very well with a Markan theology in which faith and hope despite persecution and death
is much more important than visions, apparitions and even revelations.

    </a>

<blockquote class="fragment fade-down">
    <pre>List of the clues suggesting Mark 15:40-16:8 as being an early interpolation:
A) "After three days" not matching the forty hours:
B) Peter as not one of the disciples:
C) Jesus is already anointed for burial (prior to his arrest):
D) The 'empty tomb' passage starts by "retroactive" "data":
E) Naming of women:
F) The parable of the tenants does not foresee Jesus' "honorable" burial:
G) The verse before the 'empty tomb' seems well-suited for a gospel ending, more so relative to a Gentile audience under Roman rule:</pre>


    <pre class="fragment fade-down">

In view of the aforementioned points (foremost the first one), I think there is more than enough for claiming "Mark" did not write the 'empty tomb' passage.
Then considering, in order to "prove" Jesus' resurrection, "Mark" relied only on:
a) the (alleged) prophecies about it by Jesus himself (as in 8:31, 9:31, 10:34), combined with he being an excellent prophet (even predicting the fall of Jerusalem!).
b) the alleged prior resurrection of a biblical notable: Moses' one, "proven" in 9:2-8.
c) little else, except for the testimony of Paul (1 Corinthians 9:1) and likely other "apostles in Christ", claiming to have "seen" the heavenly Jesus in some way.
It makes sense an early editor/interpolator (probably the first one) felt more was needed, more so in term of physical direct "evidence".
However, a bodily reappearance was not dared going for: that will be done later by others and added on to gMark.</pre>

    <h4>Peter, James, Paul: 1 Corinthians 15:3-8</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received:
  <q style="color: green;">that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried,
that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.</q>
After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.</pre>

    </blockquote>
    <small>The Corinthians knew Cephas / Peter well enough that some identified as his followers.
    Paul would lose credibility if he falsely claimed Peter encountered the risen Jesus. </small>

    <div class="fragment">
    <h4>John the Baptist: Mark 6:14-29</h4>
    <small>Jesus isn't even the first prophet in Mark to be linked with forgiveness of sins,
    to be arrested and executed, to be buried in a tomb, and to have rumors of resurrection.
    (And after he died his movement continued to spread and his institution of water baptism still persists.)</small>
    <blockquote>
    <pre>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known.
Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
Others said, “He is Elijah.” ...
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and ... he sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head...
On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</pre>

    <h2>Why did Mark go viral ...</h2>
    <h2 class="fragment"><small>despite not including resurrection appearances?</small></h2>

    <p class="fragment"><small>We find this surprising because we are looking backwards through the later gospels which included resurrection encounters.
        Mark's first audiences were perfectly fine not having those encounters <b>in their Passion play</b>.</small></p>
    <p class="fragment"><small>
    The resurrection is an afterthought in Mark (even including the proposed postscript).
    Mark isn't trying to convince his audience that Jesus is the Son of God - he isn't writing <b class="green-highlight">that they may believe</b>.
    Mark is reminding his audience how <b class="red-highlight">a true Messiah saves the world, beginning a new age</b>.</small></p>

    <div class="fragment">
    <p>
<b>Conjecture:</b> It had become traditional to have a strong separation between Jesus's suffering and the hope of resurrection.
Perhaps originally the Markan community was recounting only the former before Passover and the latter only after.
        <small>This shouldn't be a surprise - we still do this.</small>

    <h2>Joseph of Arimathea in the gospels</h2>
    <p>The accounts of the burial, empty tomb, and resurrection appearances undergo embellishment and apologetic development.

        <cite>-- Mark 15:43-46</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote class="fragment"><pre>When it was evening, there came <u class="red-highlight">a rich man from Arimathea</u>, named Joseph, who also was <u class="red-highlight">a disciple of Jesus</u>. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
        And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and laid it in <u class="green-highlight">his own new tomb</u>, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. </pre>
        <cite>-- Matthew 27:57-59</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote class="fragment"><pre>Now there was a man named Joseph, <u class="red-highlight">a member of the Council</u>, a good and upright man, who <u class="red-highlight">had not consented to their decision and action</u>. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body.
        Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one <u class="green-highlight">in which no one had yet been laid</u>.</pre>

        <li>A popular explanation for John setting the crucifixion <u>before Passover</u> is to portray Jesus as the Passover Lamb.</li>

        <h2>The Sabbath is a plot device</h2>
        <p>The Sabbath is a plot device originally introduced to explain why the women couldn't anoint the body on the same day thus justifying their visit on the first day of the week.</p>
        <blockquote>
<pre>
And when evening had come,
<del class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="40"><del class="fragment custom highlight" data-fragment-index="25">since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
</del></del>some members of the council went to Pilate and asked that they might bury the bodies.
And they laid them in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And they rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

<del class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="40"><del class="fragment custom highlight" data-fragment-index="35">
When the Sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome
bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
</del></del>And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
And they were saying to one another,
“Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — it was very large.
And entering the tomb, they saw
that the body of Jesus was missing.
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them.</pre>

    <h2>Speculation regarding the evolution of the postscript <br />which grows consistently wilder</h2>
    <p class="fragment">If the theory of the postscript is granted, how might the story have started and then evolved?</p>
    <ul class="fragment">
        <li>If the postscript contains obvious signs of rapid apologetic development, it seems reasonable to extrapolate that
        this apologetic development also occurred in the immediately prior non-written account.</li>
        <li class="fragment">The "original" gospel of Mark (and the final gospel) would typically have been consumed as dramatized readings.</li>
        <li class="fragment">Maybe it was originally loosely compiled from short dramas that christian communities used to perform regularly,
        and part of its popularity was as a resource for short plays.</li>
        <li class="fragment">There was a strong focus on the events leading up to the crucifixion -
            perhaps this reflected a church practise of remembering those events annually before Passover.</li>
        <li class="fragment">Surely there were also retellings and plays of resurrection encounters, but only after Passover.</li>
        <li class="fragment">Probably these were assumed to be in Galilee.</li>
        <li class="fragment">One Passover there is a novel alternative to the resurrection performance -
        Peter (or possibly just some anonymous members of the Eleven) goes to a tomb outside of Jerusalem and finds it empty.</li>
        <li class="fragment">This new scene is immediately popular, and within a few weeks has been performed in several churches.</li>
        <li class="fragment">As the next Passover approaches (at the original church) there is interest in
            integrating the resurrection prequel into the pre-existing resurrection play(s). </li>
        <li class="fragment">During rehearsal, it becomes apparent that the transition from the tomb to Galilee will be dramatically problematic,
            because Peter and the disciples are meant to be in fear and despair and completely unprepared for the appearance of Jesus.</li>
        <li class="fragment">Thus Peter (and / or the disciples) are replaced with women.</li>
        <li class="fragment">The performance is a hit and this prequel starts to be repeated outside of the retellings of resurrection encounters.</li>
        <li class="fragment">It is found to have evangelistic appeal, given the context of the well known christian claim that Jesus had risen and appeared to his disciples.</li>

        <ul class="fragment">
            <li>At some point an ambitious church attending playwright sits down with a blank sheet of paper to create an epilogue to the gospel.</li>
            <li class="fragment">This, initially separate, account sparks interest, but being written down it can be subjected to stiffer critique.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Soon, the playwright learns to think like a critic and - with the help of a few rehearsals and written revisions -
                manages to develop a script for a live performance. In this revision the young man in a linen cloth links the burial scene to that of the empty tomb.</li>
            <li class="fragment">This still isn't quite robust but - after someone tells him that Joseph of Arimathea was known to bury crucifixion victims -
                he knows how to fix it. His regular audience are a little surprised that the young man is seized during Jesus's arrest rather than burial,
                but it isn't confusing because they've seen him perform exactly this part before. </li>
            <li class="fragment">This is the version of Mark which goes viral - temporarily - and becomes the template for all the narrative gospels.</li>

    <h2>Anticipated Manuscript Evidence</h2>
    <p class="fragment">The proposed revision history is derived entirely from existing texts. <br />
    However, it does propose that Mark was initially planned to end at Mark 15:39. <br />
    What new manuscript evidence could be seen to strengthen this proposition?</p>
    <p class="fragment">There are fewer manuscripts for Mark than for the later gospels.<br />
        There are no manuscripts definitively establishing the existence of the well accepted sayings gospel.<br />
        How much less likely is it to find manuscript evidence for earlier drafts of the gospel of Mark?</p>
    <p class="fragment">No matter, let us consider what forms of manuscript evidence would be supportive of this earlier Mark,
        (ordered by approximate weight):</p>
    <ul class="fragment">
        <li>a fragment which ends at Mark 15:39.</li>
        <li class="fragment">a fragment of Mark 15 which does not contain the timestamps - the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour.</li>
        <li class="fragment">an ending of Mark which doesn't mention the women at the cross.</li>
        <li class="fragment">an ending of Mark which doesn't mention Joseph of Arimathea.</li>
        <li class="fragment">a fragment of Mark 14 without v28 or v51.</li>
        <li class="fragment">an account of the Transfiguration or Jesus walking on the water which don't align with the gospels.</li>
        <li class="fragment">early christian writings which indicate that Mark underwent revisions.
            e.g. the Mar Saba letter, if found and accepted as plausibly Clementine,
            would support an early belief that Mark's gospel underwent revision.</li>

For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</pre>
