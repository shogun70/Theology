    <h3 class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">Secret Mark?</h3>
    <blockquote class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
        <pre>
My theory, then, is that canonical Mark dismembered <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>'s story of the young man's resurrection and initiation</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
Thus, for example, the “tomb” in Mark 16:2, 3, 5, 8 comes from the “tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 1v26; 2rl, 2, 6;
“who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb” in Mark 16:3
comes from “rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb” in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r1–2;
and, especially, the “young man” in the tomb in Mark 16:5 comes from the “young man” in the tomb in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r3,4,6. </pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
But that raises a question I did not realize earlier.
When you remove those elements, what is actually left for a conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>?
...
Did <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> conclude with any story about finding the empty tomb?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">
The obvious answer is that of course it did. There are still the women.
But now I notice a curious coincidence that I missed before. 
There are three women identified in <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b> 2r14–16 as “the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome”.
There are also three women mentioned in Mark 15:40 as “Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome”
...
Is that too much coincidence?</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down">...
I think that, once again, canonical Mark has simply relocated the textual debris of a censored incident from <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.
...
The three women were not, any more than the young man in the tomb, part of the conclusion to <b class="red-highlight">Secret Mark</b>.</pre>

            </p>

...
<em style="color: green">My proposal is that the original version of Mark's Gospel ended with the centurion's confession in 15:39.</em>
...
I realize, of course, that such a claim lacks any external or manuscript evidence
unless one retrojects the fact that redoing the ending of Mark became a small industry in the early church.
The evidence for it is internal and circumstantial, tentative, hypothetical, and clearly controversial.</pre>
        <pre class="fragment custom fade-in fade-down"><u class="red-highlight">
But it fits very well with a Markan theology in which faith and hope despite persecution and death
is much more important than visions, apparitions and even revelations.

<blockquote class="fragment fade-down">
    <pre>
List of the clues suggesting Mark 15:40-16:8 as being an early interpolation:
A) "After three days" not matching the forty hours:
B) Peter as not one of the disciples:
C) Jesus is already anointed for burial (prior to his arrest):
D) The 'empty tomb' passage starts by "retroactive" "data":
E) Naming of women:
F) The parable of the tenants does not foresee Jesus' "honorable" burial:
G) The verse before the 'empty tomb' seems well-suited for a gospel ending, more so relative to a Gentile audience under Roman rule:

    </pre>

    <pre class="fragment fade-down">

In view of the aforementioned points (foremost the first one), I think there is more than enough for claiming "Mark" did not write the 'empty tomb' passage.
Then considering, in order to "prove" Jesus' resurrection, "Mark" relied only on:
a) the (alleged) prophecies about it by Jesus himself (as in 8:31, 9:31, 10:34), combined with he being an excellent prophet (even predicting the fall of Jerusalem!).
b) the alleged prior resurrection of a biblical notable: Moses' one, "proven" in 9:2-8.
c) little else, except for the testimony of Paul (1 Corinthians 9:1) and likely other "apostles in Christ", claiming to have "seen" the heavenly Jesus in some way.
It makes sense an early editor/interpolator (probably the first one) felt more was needed, more so in term of physical direct "evidence".
However, a bodily reappearance was not dared going for: that will be done later by others and added on to gMark.

King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known.

But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and ... he sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head.

    <h3>The Day of Preparation (for the Sabbath)</h3>
    <p>Jesus is apparently crucified on the Day of Preparation but this detail is not divulged until it is mentioned as the reason to get Jesus off his cross.</p>

    <h3>After three days</h3>
    <p>On three occasions Jesus predicts he will rise <b class="red-highlight">after</b> three days.
    Yet his death is the late in the day before the Sabbath and his resurrection no later than first thing on the day after the Sabbath.<br />
    Matthew and Luke change each prediction to <b class="red-highlight">on</b> the third day. <br />
    John places the death at least a day earlier, either for theological reasons or perhaps to address this discrepancy between prediction and story. </p>

    <h3>Anointing the body</h3>
    <p>The women's reason for going to the tomb is to anoint the body, but you do this before burial. <br />
    Matthew addresses issue by not mentioning it. John "fixes" it by having Joseph and Nicodemus perform the anointing.</p>
    <p>Moreover, this reason is doubly invalidated because Jesus was already anointed for burial in Bethany -
    a story which surely would not have been given such significance if Mark was thinking of the women at the tomb? <br />
    Or is this dramatic foreshadowing or insider knowledge?</p>

    <h3>Timestamps of Good Friday</h3>
    <p>There is a strong continuity of timestamps on the day of crucifixion:</p>

        <li>he is crucified when "it was the third hour"</li>

        <li>he dies "at the ninth hour"</li>
        <li>he is taken from the cross "when evening had come"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you see the pattern it is hard not to think that the timestamps were deliberately included to mark out a <b>whole</b> day, including the burial. <br />
    Doesn't that rule out the proposed postscript? <br />
    Maybe, but it could have been coincidence. Or the pattern could have been enhanced with some inserts into Mark 15.

                    In fact, possibly the only thing contested about him is that he was a follower of Jesus.

            <p>If it is the same man then surely that confirms Mark was thinking about the empty tomb when he wrote the arrest scene? </p>
            <p>Perhaps, but it is a strange tangent to the scene we find it in - it isn't impossible that it was inserted after the postscript was written.
                (Movies and plays will tweak earlier scenes when later scenes require it.)</p>

took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.
And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead,
he granted the corpse to Joseph.
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down,
wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.
And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

When the Sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome
bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.

And they were saying to one another,
“Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — it was very large.
And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.
