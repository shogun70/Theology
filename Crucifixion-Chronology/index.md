# An alternate chronology of the crucifixion

What if Jesus was crucified around the time of the solar eclipse on 24th November 29AD?

This is what Julius Africanus claims that the historian Thallus proposed. 

> On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.  
-- Julius Africanus (quoted by Syncellus)

## Steel-manning

I'm going to steel-man the position that in fact Thallus was correct.  

This will involve **assuming** it is historical, interpreting Paul's letters (and Acts) in that light, and seeing if it seems to corroborate the thesis. 

I will be ignoring unknowable factors such as cloud-cover.  

I'll also have to explain seemingly contradictory evidence, of which the most obvious is that solar eclipses cannot be described as a darkening which lasted hours, and that the eclipse in 29AD was only just over 90% in Jerusalem.  

What to expect during a partial and total solar eclipse:
<https://science.nasa.gov/feature/solar-eclipse-guide/>


There is also the issue that the gospels universally place the crucifixion at Passover.  
But I will look at the gospels **last**.


## The Darkening = Solar eclipse

Aside: we don't have Thallus writings so we don't know he actually mentioned the crucifixion. We don't even know when he wrote but there is some conjecture that Josephus referred to him, placing him at around 50AD.  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallus_(historian)>

Julian Africanus also claimed that the chronicler Phlegon of Tralles confirmed the same event:

> Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Cæsar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth — manifestly that one of which we speak.  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegon_of_Tralles>

This seems like a misrepresentation of Phlegon, given this quote from Eusebius: 

> In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars in the heavens were seen. And there was an earthquake in Bithynia which overthrew many houses in the city of Nicaea.  
-- Phlegon of Tralles (quoted by Eusebius)

Aside: Phlegon was a collector of Marvels, so conceptually it would not be surprising for him to have written that an eclipse lasted three hours and occurred at the full moon.  
However there doesn't seem to be a good explanation for why Eusebius (and Origen too) would provide direct quotes of Phlegon which do not contain those elements. 

Phlegon is certainly referring to the eclipse in November 29AD. 
The noteworthiness of the earthquake is not that several houses fell down. It must be that it coincided with the eclipse. And a total eclipse in Bythnia at around midday is certainly the one in 29AD. 


The synoptic gospels also assert the darkness began at the sixth hour. 
More poignant is that it was over the whole land, not just Jerusalem. 
The authors were claiming that this - presumably well attested darkening - coincided with the crucifixion and confirmed that Jesus was the Son of God.  

While Mark and Luke only mention the darkness (beginning at the sixth hour), Matthew is all in on highlighting the cosmic significance of the moment. 

> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.  
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying...  
“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  
...  
And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.  
-- Matthew 27:45-51


It is clear that in at least Mark and Matthew the darkness has a theological purpose - to demonstrate that even God abandoned Jesus.  
It is plausible that Mark could have exaggerated a momentary event for dramatic purposes. 
Perhaps the contemporary Christian retelling simply resembled: 

> “And on that day,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.
-- Amos 8:9


As stated previously, the eclipse wasn't total in Jerusalem (or even Galilee) - it wouldn't have even been particularly dark. 
But such is the nature of solar eclipses and the ancients were hyper-vigilant for signs in the heavens - certainly there were people in Jerusalem (or Sepphoris) who would have known that an eclipse was occurring, and it would have been confirmed in short order from the further north.  

If Christians were telling eachother that an eclipse somewhere coincided with the crucifixion, it wouldn't take too long in the retelling for a partial eclipse over Jerusalem to become a darkening over the whole land. 

Phlegon is presumed to have written in the mid-second century, so it is possible he knew of the Christian tradition and viewed it as a confirmation of an independent non-Christian record (maybe even Thallus). 

Plausibly he had even read the gospels, although Origen indicates that while he knew of Jesus and Peter he was misinformed: 

> Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events (although falling into confusion about some things which refer to Peter, as if they referred to Jesus), but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.

Since I'm steelmanning, let's presume that Thallus did actually record that Christians were claiming a darkness at Jesus death. This would make him the earliest unambiguous source for this (if we accept that Thallus wrote mid-first century). 

## Corroborating evidence 

Is there any potentially corroborating data? 

What about that Antioch - right on the path of totality for the solar eclipse - was an early stronghold of Chrisitanity? 

> Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.  
...  
Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch... And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.  
-- Acts 11:19-26

![Solar eclipse over Antioch, Tarsus, Iconium](./Solar-Eclipse-Antioch.png)

Tarsus would also have been on the path of totality.
Traditionally, Saint Paul was born in Tarsus but living in or near Jerusalem when the church began. 
If his extended family was based in Tarsus it could contribute to explaining why some of his relatives were early converts.

> Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.  
-- Romans 16:7

Saint Paul confirms that he and Peter were both in Antioch and that there were Jewish and Gentile christians.

> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
-- Galatians 2:11-12

More directly, Saint Paul says that the Galatians were in some way eyewitnesses to Jesus crucifixion. 

> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!  
-- Galatians 3:1

Maybe this is even the sense of what is captured in Paul's interaction with King Herod Agrippa: 

> And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.”  
But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly.  
For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.  
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” 
-- Acts 26:24-27

## Omens & Prodigies / Signs & Wonders

If this is a clue that early Christians were claiming the solar eclipse demonstrated the significance of Jesus death, then it has a strong resonance with the folklore surrounding the assassination of Julius Caesar. 

> Portentous and protracted eclipses of the sun also occur, such as the one after the murder of Caesar, when the sun remained pale for almost a whole year, during which time the produce of the earth was deficient and of poor quality.  
-- Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, Book II, Chapter 30  

Presumed to be due to Mount Okmuk erupting: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Okmok#43_BCE:_Okmok_II_eruption)>
  
> The only place in the whole world where a comet is worshipped is a temple at Rome. His late Majesty Augustus had deemed this comet very propitious to himself; as it had appeared at the beginning of his rule, at some games which, not long after the decease of his father Caesar, as a member of the college founded by him he was celebrating in honour of Mother Venus. In fact he made public the joy that it gave him in these words: 'On the very days of my Games a comet was visible for seven days in the northern part of the sky. It was rising about an hour before sunset, and was a bright star, visible from all lands. The common people believed that this star signified the soul of Caesar received among the spirits of the immortal gods, and on this account the emblem of a star was added to the bust of Caesar that we shortly afterwards dedicated in the forum.'  
-- Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, Book II, Chapter 25  

Caesar's comet: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Comet)>


These celestial events were all very convenient for Augustus who was seeking to establish the new age of the Roman Empire.  

It seems that Saint Peter was also propagandizing a turning point in history.  

> But Peter ... raised his voice and addressed them: ‘Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem ... this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:  
“In the last days it will be, God declares,  
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,  
    and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy...  
And I will show portents in the heaven above.  
    and signs on the earth below,  
        blood, and fire, and smoky mist.  
The sun shall be turned to darkness  
    and the moon to blood,  
        before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.  
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.        
-- Acts 2:14-21

If the sun turned to darkness is the solar eclipse, what is the moon turned to blood?  
A blood moon can be caused by dust or smoke, but the most common association is with a lunar eclipse. Intriguingly, just two weeks after the solar eclipse there was a lunar eclipse.  
<https://eclipsewise.com/lunar/LEprime/0001-0100/LE0029Dec09Pprime.html>

Being a partial lunar eclipse it would not be a classic blood moon unless it was accompanied by dust or smoke. But a knowledgeable person could have been able to point it out, especially to people who had seen the total lunar eclipse which occurred six months earlier.  

![Lunar eclipses](https://eclipsewise.com/lunar/LEhelp/images/TLE2014Apr-Phases-1w.jpg)  

<https://eclipsewise.com/lunar/LEprime/0001-0100/LE0029Jun14Tprime.html>  


Some christian atheists argue that these Old Testament images of cosmic upheaval would have been understood as metaphor for dramatic socio-political change. 

But any reading of ancient historians demonstrates that even if they themselves were not superstitious, the mass of humanity still was. 

> There had also been portents from heaven and earth, by which not only the common people but also leading men were disturbed. Lightning struck frequently, by which both the Capitol and the Temple of Vesta and the emperor's house were damaged. And frequent earthquakes occurred, by which many cities throughout Campania were overthrown, and more were damaged. All these things were believed to be of divine wrath rather than of chance."  
-- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Nero, Chapter 32

There are hints that Saint Paul - if he didn't exactly think the same - at least tapped into this kind of thinking. 

> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  
...  
Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  
...  
And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
-- Romans 1:18-32

He even seems to allude to seismic activity, like a first century Tim LaHaye.

> We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.  
-- Romans 8:22-23

> The Bible tells us in Matthew 24 that one of the signs of the last days - one of the birth pangs to occur - is an increase in earthquake activity and intensity. We're seeing that happen here. It's not just earthquakes, but hurricanes and all kinds of natural disasters.  
-- Earthquakes and End Times: <https://www.bereanbiblechurch.org/transcripts/matthew/Earthquakes_and_End_Times.htm>


Substitute Roman gods for Yahweh, and sometimes Paul doesn't seem so different to prevailing Roman moralizing. 

> For when the earth, which is the nourisher and the mother, as it were, of all things, is struck with the fires of heaven, and gives forth a groan, and trembles and opens in chasms, it seems to give a warning of divine wrath, and to command us to guard against the impious wickedness of men.  
-- Cicero, De Natura Deorum:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum>


See also our only hint of Paul preaching to Athenians:

> Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned ... in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.  
Some ... said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities” — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection...  
So Paul ... said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious...  
Being God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.    
The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,  
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”  
-- Acts 17:16-31

## Alternate explanations

Before turning to the gospels, we should not forget that - even if we presume that by mid-century Christians were claiming that the 29AD solar and lunar eclipses were confirmations of Jesus significance -
there are alternative explanations which maintain a Passover crucifixion. 

For example:  
PG Cavalcanti, 29 AD: Year of a Blood Moon and a Solar Eclipse  
<https://www.academia.edu/128874478/29_AD_Year_of_a_Blood_Moon_and_a_Solar_Eclipse>  


## Explaining the Passover tradition

The proposition that Jesus’s crucifixion aligned with a solar eclipse in November would invalidate the Passover chronology of the Synoptic Gospels. Yet this very idea assumes that the Gospels have captured a genuine early Christian memory - that is, the "darkness" over the whole land. This paradox illustrates (to me at least) that any explanation of the Gospel narrative will ultimately look like a compromise between historicism and mythicism. 

Another example which a proponent of this alternate chronology will want to claim as an authenitc memory would be the Jewish authorities not wanting to arrest Jesus during the festival. 

> The chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. “But not during the festival,” they said, “or the people may riot.”  
-- Mark 14:1-2

The synoptic tradition timed this at Passover (technically just before), but it would be just as relevant at any of the pilgrimage festivals, including Sukkot. 

In fact, this is almost perfect for the alternate chronology where Jesus was arrested **after** Sukkot and executed in the lull before Hannukah. 

### Postulating sources

If Jesus was crucified around the solar eclipse of 24th November 29AD, it is plausible he was in Jerusalem at Sukkot - the festival of Tabernacles. 

Several scholars have in fact suggested that the triumphal entry - recorded by all the gospels as part of Jesus final week - is reminiscent of Sukkot, with the waving of palm branches and cries of Hosanna.  
<https://vridar.org/2011/01/05/liberating-jesus-from-the-letter-of-the-gospel-narrative/>

Intriguingly, John's gospel does record Jesus going to this feast:

> After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want to go about in Judea because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him. But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do. No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret...”  
For even his own brothers did not believe in him.  
Therefore Jesus told them, “My time is not yet here; for you any time will do. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil. You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come.” After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee.  
However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.  
-- John 7:1-10

Could the triumphal entry capture an authentic historical memory? 
Certainly it would be no surprise if Jewish adjacent christian communities were retelling such a story annually at Sukkot. 

This apparent pairing of a Jewish ritual with a Jesus anecdote is reminiscent of a perhaps more famous metaphor - the resonance between the story of Jesus and Barabbas and the ritual of the two goats of the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).  
There seems to be no shortage of commentary on this, but I'll link to one at random plus the Epistle of Barnabas which possibly captures the original seed of the idea. 

- Jesus Christ, Barabbas, the Two Goats, and You:  
  <https://jesusistherefuge.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/jesus-christ-barabbas-the-two-goats-and-you/>
- Epistle of Barnabas:  
  <https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/barnabas-lake.html>

Once you see some resonance between elements in the Passion narrative and Jewish rituals and festivals, it is easy (too easy) to start finding them everywhere, like source criticism on steroids. 

For what it's worth, here's a speculative list:

- The triumphal entry: Sukkot
- The cleansing of the temple: Hannukah
- The last supper / new covenant: Passover / Shavuot
- Watching and praying on the Mount of Olives: Leil Shimurim
- Jesus or Barabbas: Yom Kippur

Finally, the story of the Garden of Gethsemene - literally the garden of the oil press on the Mount of Olives - would be a nod to the actual timing of Jesus last days in November, the month of the olive harvest. And of course the obvious image of Jesus being brought under pressure. 

John's gospel records Jesus attending five different festivals in Jerusalem: two Passovers, Sukkot, Hannukah, and an unnamed one. 
Does this demonstrate that Christians knew stories about Jesus in Jerusalem across the Jewish calendar (surely not controversial) or that they were repurposing Jewish ritual to remember Christ and the New Convenant? 

None of this is novel questioning and rather than explore it more here I will just refer to the scholarship of Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack and the like. 

### Evolution

When Jesus is arrested and condemned, he is just a would-be John the Baptist, executed for getting up the nose of the wrong powerful people. Yet the occurence of the solar eclipse is confirmation for his followers that he had divine approval. 

So what does it mean? Why would Yahweh let a chosen one suffer - not just a drawn out death - but also the humiliation of being hung on a tree? He is both under a curse and vindicated. 

In hindsight we know the first christians resolved this paradox by the innovative theology that Jesus took the curse of others - that he died for sins. 

This probably resonates most strongly with the Day of Atonement. 
And there is lots of language in the New Testament epistles which alludes to the Day of Atonement:

> Into the [Most Holy Place] the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.  
...  
But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.
-- Hebrews 9:7,11-12

> Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; they are now justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood.
-- Romans 3:23-25

> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.   
-- 1 John 2:2


But the concept of a substitionary sacrifice also resonates with the Passover Lamb, and certainly Paul at least was using the Festival of Unleavened Bread to remind churches not to take Jesus sacrifice for granted. 

> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  
-- 1 Corinthians 5:6-8

Of course, the maximallist interpretation of this passage is that christians celebrated Passover because Jesus was crucified at Passover. 

That option isn't available when steel-manning the current proposition, so here is a list of factors which may have favoured the memorial of Jesus sacrifice being at Passover:

- As Hebrews states, the Day of Atonement is an annual sacrifice. The original Passover Lamb was once for all time. 
- Passover has a richer narrative with broad application. 
- Passover was a pilgrimage festival which would fit with the gospel narrative of crowds being in Jerusalem when Jesus was crucified. 

And finally, there is these two "firstfuits" analogies of Paul:

> But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.  
-- 1 Corinthians 15:20

> And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.  
-- Romans 8:23

There are two Jewish firstfruits offerings:

- Barley, **the first Sunday after Passover**:  
  <https://tmurphywrites.com/feast-of-the-sheaf-of-first-fruits-jesus-as-the-sheaf/>

- Wheat, **at Pentecost**:  
  <https://tmurphywrites.com/pentecost-from-barley-to-wheat/>

Again, the maximallist will say Paul's use of firstfruits in those passages merely confirms that Jesus died and rose at Passover, and the Holy Spirit came at Pentecost. 


## Contradictory evidence

- Why aren't there more allusions to an eclipse in the NT letters?
- I would expect Peter to have been repeating it frequently, and yet neither of the letters attributed to Peter mention it. 
- Why doesn't Josephus give any hint of it? He seems fine to include signs and wonders. 
- Shouldn't it have been easier to convince followers of John the Baptist? 
- Mark seems to use the darkness as imagery for God abandoning Jesus. If the first christians took it as validation of Jesus, how did that evolve into the way Mark uses it?  
  OTOH the gospels do have the centurion seem to take the darkness as validation. 
- Why do the gospels say "No sign will be given"?
