# An alternate chronology of the crucifixion

What if Jesus was crucified around the time of the solar eclipse on 24th November 29AD?

This is what Julius Africanus claims that the historian Thallus proposed. 

> On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.  
-- Julius Africanus (quoted by Syncellus)

I'm going to steel-man the position that in fact Thallus was correct.  

This will involve assuming it is historical, interpreting Paul's letters (and Acts) in that light, and seeing if it seems to corroborate the thesis. 

I will be ignoring unknowable factors such as cloud-cover.  

I'll also have to explain seemingly contradictory evidence, of which the most obvious is that solar eclipses are not noticeable for hours, and that the eclipse in 29AD was only partial in Jerusalem.  

What to expect during a partial and total solar eclipse:

There is also the issue that the gospels universally place the crucifixion at Passover.  
But I will look at that **last**.


Aside: we don't have Thallus writings so we don't know he actually mentioned the crucifixion. We don't even know when he wrote but there is some conjecture that Josephus referred to him, placing him at around 50AD.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallus_(historian)

Julian Africanus also claimed that the chronicler Phlegon of Tralles confirmed the same event:

> Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Cæsar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth — manifestly that one of which we speak.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegon_of_Tralles

This seems like a misrepresentation of Phlegon, given this quote from Eusebius: 

> In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars in the heavens were seen. And there was an earthquake in Bithynia which overthrew many houses in the city of Nicaea.  
-- Phlegon of Tralles (quoted by Eusebius)

Aside: Phlegon was a collector of Marvels, so conceptually it would not be surprising for him to have written that an eclipse lasted three hours and occurred at the full moon.  
However there doesn't seem to be a good explanation for why Eusebius (and Origen too) would provide direct quotes of Phlegon which do not contain those elements. 

Phlegon is certainly referring to the eclipse in November 29AD. 
The noteworthiness of the earthquake is not that several houses fell down. It must be that it coincided with the eclipse. And a total eclipse in Bythnia at around midday is certainly the one in 29AD. 


The synoptic gospels also assert the darkness began at the sixth hour. 
More poignant is that it was over the whole land, not just Jerusalem. 
The authors were claiming that this - presumably well attested darkening - coincided with the crucifixion and confirmed that Jesus was the Son of God.  

While Mark and Luke only mention the darkness (beginning at the sixth hour), Matthew is all in on highlighting the cosmic significance of the moment. 

> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.  
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying...  
“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  
...  
And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.  
-- Matthew 27:45-51


It is clear that in at least Mark and Matthew the darkness has a theological purpose - to demonstrate that even God abandoned Jesus.  
It is plausible that Mark could have exaggerated a momentary event for dramatic purposes. 
Perhaps the contemporary Christian retelling was something like: 

> “And on that day,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.
-- Amos 8:9


As stated previously, the eclipse wasn't total in Jerusalem (or even Galilee) - it wouldn't have even been particularly dark. 
But such is the nature of solar eclipses and the ancients were hyper-vigilant for signs in the heavens - certainly there were people in Jerusalem (or Sepphoris) who would have known that an eclipse was occurring, and it would have been confirmed in short order from the further north.  

If Christians were telling eachother that an eclipse occurred during the crucifixion, it wouldn't take too long in the retelling for a partial eclipse to become a full eclipse over Jerusalem. 

Phlegon is presumed to have written in the mid-second century, so it is possible he knew of the Christian tradition and viewed it as a confirmation of an independent non-Christian record (maybe even Thallus). 

Plausibly he had even read the gospels, although Origen indicates that while he knew of Jesus and Peter he was misinformed: 

> Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events (although falling into confusion about some things which refer to Peter, as if they referred to Jesus), but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.

Since I'm steelmanning, let's presume that Thallus did actually record that Christians were claiming a darkness at Jesus death. This would make him the earliest unambiguous source for this (if we accept that Thallus wrote mid-first century). 

Is there any potentially corroborating data? 

What about that Antioch was an early stronghold of Chrisitanity? It also would have been right on the path of the total solar eclipse. 

> Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.  
...  
Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch... And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.  
-- Acts 11:19-26

![Solar eclipse over Antioch, Tarsus, Iconium](./Solar-Eclipse-Antioch.png)

Tarsus would also have been on the path of totality.
Traditionally, Saint Paul was born in Tarsus but living in or near Jerusalem when the church began. 
If his extended family was based in Tarsus it could contribute to explaining why some of his relatives were early converts.

> Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.  
-- Romans 16:7

Saint Paul confirms that he and Peter were both in Antioch and that there were Jewish and Gentile christians.

> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
-- Galatians 2:11-12

More directly, Saint Paul potentially says that the Galatians were in some way eyewitnesses to Jesus crucifixion. 

> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!  
-- Galatians 3:1

Maybe this is even the sense of what is captured in Paul's interaction with King Herod Agrippa: 

> And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.”  
But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly.  
For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.  
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” 
-- Acts 26:24-27


If this is a clue that early Christians were claiming the solar eclipse demonstrated the significance of Jesus death, then it has a strong resonance with the folklore surrounding the assassination of Julius Caesar. 

> Portentous and protracted eclipses of the sun also occur, such as the one after the murder of Caesar, when the sun remained pale for almost a whole year, during which time the produce of the earth was deficient and of poor quality.  
-- Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, Book II, Chapter 30  
(Presumed to be due to Mount Okmuk erupting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Okmok#43_BCE:_Okmok_II_eruption)
  
> The only place in the whole world where a comet is worshipped is a temple at Rome. His late Majesty Augustus had deemed this comet very propitious to himself; as it had appeared at the beginning of his rule, at some games which, not long after the decease of his father Caesar, as a member of the college founded by him he was celebrating in honour of Mother Venus. In fact he made public the joy that it gave him in these words: 'On the very days of my Games a comet was visible for seven days in the northern part of the sky. It was rising about an hour before sunset, and was a bright star, visible from all lands. The common people believed that this star signified the soul of Caesar received among the spirits of the immortal gods, and on this account the emblem of a star was added to the bust of Caesar that we shortly afterwards dedicated in the forum.'  
-- Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, Book II, Chapter 25  
[Caesar's comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Comet)


These celestial events were all very convenient for Augustus who was seeking to establish the new age of the Roman Empire.  

It seems that Saint Peter was also propagandizing a turning point in history.  

> But Peter ... raised his voice and addressed them: ‘Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem ... this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:  
“In the last days it will be, God declares,  
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,  
    and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy...  
And I will show portents in the heaven above.  
    and signs on the earth below,  
        blood, and fire, and smoky mist.  
The sun shall be turned to darkness  
    and the moon to blood,  
        before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.  
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.        
-- Acts 2:14-21

If the sun turned to darkness is the solar eclipse, what is the moon turned to blood?  
A blood moon can be caused by dust or smoke, but the most common association is with a lunar eclipse. Intriguingly, just two weeks after the solar eclipse there was a lunar eclipse.  
https://eclipsewise.com/lunar/LEprime/0001-0100/LE0029Dec09Pprime.html

Being a partial lunar eclipse it would not be a classic blood moon unless it was accompanied by dust or smoke. But a knowledgeable person could have been able to point it out, especially to people who had seen the total lunar eclipse which occurred six months earlier.

Some christian atheists argue that these Old Testament images of cosmic upheaval would have been understood as metaphor for dramatic socio-political change. 

But any reading of ancient historians demonstrates that even if they themselves were not superstitious, the mass of humanity still was. 

> There had also been portents from heaven and earth, by which not only the common people but also leading men were disturbed. Lightning struck frequently, by which both the Capitol and the Temple of Vesta and the emperor's house were damaged. And frequent earthquakes occurred, by which many cities throughout Campania were overthrown, and more were damaged. All these things were believed to be of divine wrath rather than of chance."  
-- Suetonius, De Vita Caesarum, Nero, Chapter 32

There are hints that Saint Paul - if he didn't exactly think the same - at least tapped into this kind of thinking. 

> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  
...  
Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  
...  
And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
-- Romans 1:18-32

He even seems to allude to seismic activity, like a first century Tim LaHaye.

> We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.  
-- Romans 8:22-23

> The Bible tells us in Matthew 24 that one of the signs of the last days - one of the birth pangs to occur - is an increase in earthquake activity and intensity. We're seeing that happen here. It's not just earthquakes, but hurricanes and all kinds of natural disasters.  
-- https://www.bereanbiblechurch.org/transcripts/matthew/Earthquakes_and_End_Times.htm


Substitute Roman gods for Yahweh, and sometimes Paul doesn't seem so different to prevailing Roman moralizing. 

> For when the earth, which is the nourisher and the mother, as it were, of all things, is struck with the fires of heaven, and gives forth a groan, and trembles and opens in chasms, it seems to give a warning of divine wrath, and to command us to guard against the impious wickedness of men.  
-- [Cicero, De Natura Deorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum)


See also our only hint of Paul preaching to Athenians:

> Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned ... in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.  
Some ... said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities” — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection...  
So Paul ... said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious...  
Being God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.    
The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,  
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”  
-- Acts 17:16-31


Before turning to the gospels, we should not forget that - even if we presume that by mid-century Christians were claiming that the 29AD solar and lunar eclipses were confirmations of Jesus significance -
there are alternative explanations which maintain a Passover crucifixion.
