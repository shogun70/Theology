# How did Christianity get started?

## Introduction

Last year @paulogia0 "published" his Minimal Witnesses Hypothesis (for the existence of the church).
https://x.com/paulogia0/status/1779606868752560265

He doesn't claim this is what happened - the goal is merely to posit a plausible naturalistic origin story
which could also have evolved into the narratives captured in the NT.

This year he has tweeted that the hypothesis can't be assessed on how closely it matches the details in the Bible.

Without even looking at the comments, this reveals there has been criticism that it doesn't match "closely enough".
Reading the comments you also see some argue it couldn't reasonably evolve into the NT portrayals.

Notwithstanding the reasonableness of Paulogia's rebuttal, I also felt the hypothesis was a bit hand-wavy in parts.

This is a super-thread of speculations loosely relating to the hypothesis.

## Succession Crisis in the aftermath of Jesus death.
(Related to points 4, 5, 6)

[Christ] appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time
(most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep).
Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
-- 1 Corinthians 15:5-7

Why is it that James - the brother of the Lord (Galatians 1:19), pillar of the church (Galatians 2:19), and eventual bishop of Jerusalem - is so far down this list?
Was James out of town on the occasions the other followers encountered the risen Jesus?
Or was he present, yet unwilling to believe?
Or did Jesus simply choose moments when James wasn't present until he detected a change of heart in his brother?

This order of acknowledged appearances could be indicative of a tussle for leadership between two camps - one for Peter, the other behind James.

The gospels present Peter as Jesus number one follower - first to call him Messiah, last to leave him before his crucifixion.
They also present Peter as having a privileged place amongst the disciples.
Apart from being one of three who see the Transfiguration, he is named more than any other disciple, and he is often the first named in any list of disciples.
If the gospel portrayal is valid then Peter would seem to have been lieutenant to Jesus.

Still, when the leader dies, the next leader it seems must be found from amongst his blood relatives.
This would be especially so if there was a belief that Jesus was of the line of David.

But what about if it turned out that Jesus was alive again, and had in fact appeared to Peter?
Surely that would be a sign that Peter was meant to be the next leader, or rather, to continue as lieutenant to the temporarily absent Jesus?
Yet how credible would Peter's claim  to leadership be if he was also the only one claiming Jesus was resurrected?
By itself, not much.
But what if there were followers who would prefer Peter instead of James (Jesus brother)?
They would have an incentive to agree that they too had seen the resurrected Jesus, in order to bolster Peter's claim.
James and John - the sons of Zebedee - in particular seemed to be closely aligned with Peter.

Now none of this requires wilful deception. Quite possibly many of the disciples had a belief in resurrection of sorts.
And apparently there had been rumours that John the Baptist had resurrected, whatever that meant (Mark 14:14-16).
Maybe Peter told someone that he imagined he saw Jesus and that person - seeking to console - assured him that he didn't seem crazy and why wouldn't it be true.
(Apparently Muhammed's wife was the first person he told about his visions of the angel Gabriel and she encouraged him to believe in himself.)
So if Peter, and then some of the others, had some post-crucifixion experience - perhaps in some location that Jesus was known to frequent -
maybe disputing it felt like betrayal or at least rubbing salt into the wound.
Perhaps belief was the appropriate response for a community of faith?
And it probably doesn't hurt that having Jesus appear to you must say something positive about you.

Certainly by the time The Twelve had reported encounters with the risen Jesus it may have seemed rock solid to people who were already invested in Jesus mission being God ordained.
One could imagine they were primed to interpret nearly anything as an appearance - perhaps something like Caesar's comet, or even the Miracle of Fatima.

Once 500 people had confirmed the resurrection it was clear that the leadership could not include someone whom Jesus had not appeared to.
Advocates for Peter would have been making this point.
Who knows, maybe even Mary, the mother of Jesus (and of James), was very ready to believe the stories and was asking James why he didn't seem happy to hear them too.
Thus there was incentive and pressure for James to have his own encounter with the risen Jesus.

Our only insight into the first days of the church is the Acts of the Apostles.
From the first chapter it is clear that Peter is taking charge, which is consistent both with his role in the gospels and as first witness to the risen Jesus.
James is not explicitly mentioned but would presumably be included amongst "Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers." (Acts 1:14)
In contrast to Paul's understanding that James is one of the pillars of the church,
Acts is not inclined to acknowledge this fact until Peter has to flee the persecution from Herod Agrippa
- the first time James is mentioned in Acts it appears he is already the leader (or co-leader) of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 12:1-17)

Did the canonical gospels and Acts intentionally sideline James?
There could be hints in that direction.
The Gospel of Thomas has this quote regarding James:

The disciples said to Jesus:
We know that you will depart from us; who is it who will be great over us?
Jesus said to them:
Wherever you have come, you will go to James the Just, for whose sake heaven and earth came into being.
-- Gospel of Thomas: Saying 12

Does this capture a tradition that Thomas was part of a faction which saw James as an equal successor to Jesus?
Indeed, the Gospel of Thomas never speaks of resurrection, at least not as portrayed in the narrative gospels.
Surely John's portrayal of Thomas initially refusing to believe in the resurrection and finally being compelled to call Jesus Lord and God (John 20:24-29) is a not so subtle dig at a well known disciple?

In contrast to this, could Jesus statement that Peter is the rock on which he would build his church, immediately after Peter has called him the Messiah (Matthew 16:16-18) reflect a memory of a pro-Peter, anti-James argument?

Still, if there was indeed a tussle over succession this implies there was a reasonably strong sense that the movement would continue.
What can we say about that?


## Church growth
(Related to point 7)

Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.  
-- Acts 2:41

And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.  
-- Acts 2:47

But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.  
-- Acts 4:4

And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.  
-- Acts 5:14

This thread is one part of an exploration into Paulogia's Minimal Witnesses Hypothesis - https://x.com/paulogia0/status/1779606868752560265 -  
and whether his naturalistic hypothesis can in fact be expanded to more closely align with the NT record (or at least plausibly evolve into it).

Acts attributes early church growth primarily to (apocalyptic) preaching and secondarily to healings and perhaps speaking in tongues. 
These seem completely relatable explanations to anyone familiar with some of the fads in 20th Century Christianity. 
There also seems to be an acknowledgement that caring for the poor, and persecution also facilitated growth. 
But clearly the largest potential source of growth was universalization - first to Samaritans, then to Gentiles. 

### Apocalyptic preaching

A significant number of Jews were expecting (or at least open to) some impending apocalyptic crisis accompanied by the Messiah.
Thus there was fertile ground for apocalyptic preaching. 
This can be seen in the John the Baptist movement, mentioned in the gospels and also by Josephus.

Herod killed [John the Baptist], who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God. 
...
Herod feared that the great influence John had over the masses might lead to some form of rebellion (for they seemed ready to do anything he should advise).
-- Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18, Chapter 5

Even without John preaching revolution or claiming to be the Messiah 
it seems that the general public was hoping for it
and Herod thought it was plausible.  

Why would successfully preaching repentence be considered threatening by authorities? 

Luke provides a link:

He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, â€œYou brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruits in keeping with repentance."
...
As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ.  
John answered them ...
"His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."
...
So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.
...
But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,  added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.
-- Luke 3:7-20

See also in Acts:

"Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out,
that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you.
...
And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people." -- Acts 3:19-23

Exhortation to repentance and righteous living is the flip-side of warnings of judgement. The people interpreted judgement to coincide with the coming of God's Messiah. And how could the coming of God's anointed one not be accompanied by judgement on seemingly unjust wprldly authorities? 

Still, while this makes sense of the anticipation around John the Baptist before he died, how could it explain the apparent plausibility of Jesus being the Messiah after he died? 

Almost certainly some OT scripture was interpreted as foretelling the current events and hinting at a coming climax which of course required an urgent enrollment on the right team. 

We don't know what scripture was harnessed at first, 
but Daniel's seventy weeks seems to have been commonly conscripted for messianic predictions.

From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One comes, there will be seven â€˜sevens,â€™ and sixty-two â€˜sevens.â€™  
...
After the sixty-two â€˜sevens,â€™ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing.  
The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.  
He will confirm a covenant with many for one â€˜seven.â€™ In the middle of the â€˜sevenâ€™ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.   
And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.
-- Daniel 9:24-27

It seems trivial to claim that the Anointed One here is Jesus. 
The Caligula proposal to erect a statue of himself in the temple has not yet happened, but Pilate has taken the standard of the Roman legion - which had Caesar's image - into Jerusalem. 
To an apocalyptic Jew the resemblance to the current moment may have felt uncanny. Foreboding even.


### Signs and wonders - healings and tongues


The phenomenon of speaking in tongues may have convinced some people.
Although the miracle reports all seem to be tied to Peter and Paul.

Paul's letters do not give any indication that other apostles were associated with healing or tongues. 

### Care for "The Poor"

There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.
-- Acts 4:34-35

If the early church was providing social security then no-one would be surprised at its growth amongst "The Poor".

This is perhaps confirmed even in the late second century by Celsus:
Taking its root in the lower classes, the religion continues to spread among the vulgar: nay, one can even say it spreads because of its vulgarity and the illiteracy of its adherents.
-- The True Doctine. Celsus

But why were people selling their land to cover expenses - this indicates a sincere belief the end is near. 
The Millerite example may be instructive - 
many of them sold land or possessions or even gave them away, 
certain as they were that Jesus return was imminent.

The Essenes may also offer insight - 
they also had everything in common. 
Speculatively they may have begun with the same conviction that the end was near and then - after an initial disappointment - 
adapted to a more sustainable practice, at least for the short term. 
Perhaps they even evolved into kibbutzism in some places.

### Persecution

Persecution can strengthen religious faith. 
Naturally this is not the intention, but the reasons are not unintuitive, including:  
- Solidarity and group identity.
- It can suggest the faith is threatening to worldly powers.
- Religious persecution can create curiosity and sympathy.
- Localized persecution can trigger emigration and thus spread.

Examples in Acts:

They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. 
-- Acts 5:40-41

The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith...
Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen ... who began to argue with Stephen. But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke...
So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
-- Acts 6:7-12

The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees ... seized Peter and John and ... they put them in jail until the next day. But many who heard the message believed.
-- Acts 4:1-4

On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
...
Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
-- Acts 8:1-4

There are numerous other historical examples but an obvious one which is easily researched is the early church of Latter Day Saints.

There are, of course, counter-examples where persecution has degraded religions, with the prime example being Manichaeism which was eliminated completely. 


### Universalization

Acts describes the universalisation of Christianity as unintentional. 
The unforseen conversion of Samaritans and especially Gentiles must have been an encouragement given the perpetually delayed return of Christ. 

#### Samaritans
The conversion of Samaritans is portrayed as a welcome surprise after the persecution in Jerusalem, but it does not seem to have been controversial in Acts. It is difficult however to believe that Samaritans would be open to Christianity if it was seen as the Jerusalem founded movement presented in Acts. Perhaps this is an argument for more continuity between the Galilean origins of "The Way" and the eventual Jerusalem church. 

#### Gentiles
The conversion of Gentiles seems very surprising to the original church and moreover it must have remained controversial, even with Peter's backing. (Acts 11:2-3, Galatians 2:11-13).
It is perhaps unsurprising that a movement which started with 
"Repent for the kingdom of God is near" might be somewhat exclusivist. 
But practically it is very rational for a new religion to be more relaxed in it's gate-keeping. If the early church was providing for "The Poor" out of it's own resources then the largesse of presumably well-off Gentiles would be welcome. (Cornelius was wealthy and generous, Acts 10:1-2. Paul's fundraising, 2 Corinthians 8,9)

What might be the appeal of Christianity for first century Gentiles? 
There will of course be numerous reasons for the appeal of a new religion. The important question is which ones give it staying power?
- There were already Gentiles who were converting or sympathetic to Judaism. Christianity is attached to an already appealing religion. 
- The stories about Jesus fearless criticism of authorities, accompanied by his condemnation and crucifixion by those same authorities, may have resonated with Plato's anecdote of the truly just man. Jesus may have been acknowledged as an infallible Stoic, 
thus affiliating it with a major and growing Greek philosophy.  
- The egalitarianism of the early church must have appealed to some in the hierarchical Graeco-Roman world. 
- The  numerous (ambiguous) apocalyptic passages from OT may have felt specifically prophetic to the the turmoil in parts of the empire during the first century. 


## Paul
(Related to points 8,9)


## The gospels
(Related to point 10)


## Did Jesus claim to be the Messiah?
(Related to point 1)

### Against

- Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone. Was this because he never said it?
- Likewise, Jesus told Peter, James, John not to tell anyone about the Transfiguration.
- Few of the sayings and parables reflect an apocalyptic mindset. Suggests that apocalypticism was an optional extra in the early church. 
- Jesus is frequently called Teacher. (Is this relevant - maybe some expected the Messiah to be a Teacher)

### For

- The triumphal entry and purifying the temple seem to be designed to spark conflict (if it in fact happened).
- "I have come not to bring peace but the sword." 
- The Sanhedrin's justification for his crucifixion seems to be a messianic claim (but there is also a hint that was fabricated).
