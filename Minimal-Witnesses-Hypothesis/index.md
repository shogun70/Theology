# How did Christianity get started?

## Introduction

Last year @paulogia0 "published" his Minimal Witnesses Hypothesis (for the existence of the church).
https://x.com/paulogia0/status/1779606868752560265

He doesn't claim this is what happened - the goal is merely to posit a plausible naturalistic origin story
which could also have evolved into the narratives captured in the NT.

This year he has tweeted that the hypothesis can't be assessed on how closely it matches the details in the Bible.

Without even looking at the comments, this reveals there has been criticism that it doesn't match "closely enough".
Reading the comments you also see some argue it couldn't reasonably evolve into the NT portrayals.

Notwithstanding the reasonableness of Paulogia's rebuttal, I also felt the hypothesis was a bit hand-wavy in parts.

This is a super-thread of speculations loosely relating to the hypothesis.

## Succession Crisis in the aftermath of Jesus death.
(Related to points 4, 5, 6)

[Christ] appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time
(most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep).
Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
-- 1 Corinthians 15:5-7

Why is it that James - the brother of the Lord (Galatians 1:19), pillar of the church (Galatians 2:19), and eventual bishop of Jerusalem - is so far down this list?
Was James out of town on the occasions the other followers encountered the risen Jesus?
Or was he present, yet unwilling to believe?
Or did Jesus simply choose moments when James wasn't present until he detected a change of heart in his brother?

This order of acknowledged appearances could be indicative of a tussle for leadership between two camps - one for Peter, the other behind James.

The gospels present Peter as Jesus number one follower - first to call him Messiah, last to leave him before his crucifixion.
They also present Peter as having a privileged place amongst the disciples.
Apart from being one of three who see the Transfiguration, he is named more than any other disciple, and he is often the first named in any list of disciples.
If the gospel portrayal is valid then Peter would seem to have been lieutenant to Jesus.

Still, when the leader dies, the next leader it seems must be found from amongst his blood relatives.
This would be especially so if there was a belief that Jesus was of the line of David.

But what about if it turned out that Jesus was alive again, and had in fact appeared to Peter?
Surely that would be a sign that Peter was meant to be the next leader, or rather, to continue as lieutenant to the temporarily absent Jesus?
Yet how credible would Peter's claim  to leadership be if he was also the only one claiming Jesus was resurrected?
By itself, not much.
But what if there were followers who would prefer Peter instead of James (Jesus brother)?
They would have an incentive to agree that they too had seen the resurrected Jesus, in order to bolster Peter's claim.
James and John - the sons of Zebedee - in particular seemed to be closely aligned with Peter.

Now none of this requires wilful deception. Quite possibly many of the disciples had a belief in resurrection of sorts.
And apparently there had been rumours that John the Baptist had resurrected, whatever that meant (Mark 14:14-16).
Maybe Peter told someone that he imagined he saw Jesus and that person - seeking to console - assured him that he didn't seem crazy and why wouldn't it be true.
(Apparently Muhammed's wife was the first person he told about his visions of the angel Gabriel and she encouraged him to believe in himself.)
So if Peter, and then some of the others, had some post-crucifixion experience - perhaps in some location that Jesus was known to frequent -
maybe disputing it felt like betrayal or at least rubbing salt into the wound.
Perhaps belief was the appropriate response for a community of faith?
And it probably doesn't hurt that having Jesus appear to you must say something positive about you.

Certainly by the time The Twelve had reported encounters with the risen Jesus it may have seemed rock solid to people who were already invested in Jesus mission being God ordained.
One could imagine they were primed to interpret nearly anything as an appearance - perhaps something like Caesar's comet, or even the Miracle of Fatima.

Once 500 people had confirmed the resurrection it was clear that the leadership could not include someone whom Jesus had not appeared to.
Advocates for Peter would have been making this point.
Who knows, maybe even Mary, the mother of Jesus (and of James), was very ready to believe the stories and was asking James why he didn't seem happy to hear them too.
Thus there was incentive and pressure for James to have his own encounter with the risen Jesus.

Our only insight into the first days of the church is the Acts of the Apostles.
From the first chapter it is clear that Peter is taking charge, which is consistent both with his role in the gospels and as first witness to the risen Jesus.
James is not explicitly mentioned but would presumably be included amongst "Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers." (Acts 1:14)
In contrast to Paul's understanding that James is one of the pillars of the church,
Acts is not inclined to acknowledge this fact until Peter has to flee the persecution from Herod Agrippa
- the first time James is mentioned in Acts it appears he is already the leader (or co-leader) of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 12:1-17)

Did the canonical gospels and Acts intentionally sideline James?
There could be hints in that direction.
The Gospel of Thomas has this quote regarding James:

The disciples said to Jesus:
We know that you will depart from us; who is it who will be great over us?
Jesus said to them:
Wherever you have come, you will go to James the Just, for whose sake heaven and earth came into being.
-- Gospel of Thomas: Saying 12

Does this capture a tradition that Thomas was part of a faction which saw James as an equal successor to Jesus?
Indeed, the Gospel of Thomas never speaks of resurrection, at least not as portrayed in the narrative gospels.
Surely John's portrayal of Thomas initially refusing to believe in the resurrection and finally being compelled to call Jesus Lord and God (John 20:24-29) is a not so subtle dig at a well known disciple?

In contrast to this, could Jesus statement that Peter is the rock on which he would build his church, immediately after Peter has called him the Messiah (Matthew 16:16-18) reflect a memory of a pro-Peter, anti-James argument?

Still, if there was indeed a tussle over succession this implies there was a reasonably strong sense that the movement would continue.
What can we say about that?


## Church growth
(Related to point 7)

Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
-- Acts 2:41

And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
-- Acts 2:47

But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.
-- Acts 4:4

And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.
-- Acts 5:14

This thread is one part of an exploration into Paulogia's Minimal Witnesses Hypothesis - 
https://x.com/paulogia0/status/1779606868752560265 -
and whether his naturalistic hypothesis can in fact be expanded to more closely align with the NT record
(or at least plausibly evolve into it).

Acts attributes early church growth primarily to (apocalyptic) preaching and secondarily to healings and perhaps speaking in tongues. 
These seem completely relatable explanations to anyone familiar with some of the fads in 20th Century Christianity. 
There also seems to be an acknowledgement that caring for the poor and persecution also facilitated growth. 

### Apocalyptic preaching

A significant number of Jews were expecting (or at least open to) some impending apocalyptic crisis accompanied by the Messiah.
Thus there was fertile ground for apocalyptic preaching. 

### Signs and wonders - healings and tongues

The out-pouring of the Holy Spirit may have convinced some people.
Although the miracle reports all seem to be tied to Peter.

### Care for "The Poor"

If the early church was providing social security then no-one would be surprised at its growth.
But why were people selling their land to cover expenses - this indicates a sincere belief the end is near. Millerites.

### Persecution

Persecution can strengthen faith, e.g. Mormons. Counter-example Manichaeism.


## Paul
(Related to points 8,9)


## The gospels
(Related to point 10)


## Did Jesus claim to be the Messiah?
(Related to point 1)

### Against

- Jesus instructed his disciples not to tell anyone. Was this because he never said it?
- Likewise, Jesus told Peter, James, John not to tell anyone about the Transfiguration.
- Few of the sayings and parables reflect an apocalyptic mindset. Suggests that apocalypticism was an optional extra in the early church. 
- Jesus is frequently called Teacher. (Is this relevant - maybe some expected the Messiah to be a Teacher)

### For

- The triumphal entry and purifying the temple seem to be designed to spark conflict (if it in fact happened).
- "I have come not to bring peace but the sword." 
- The Sanhedrin's justification for his crucifixion seems to be a messianic claim (but there is also a hint that was fabricated).
